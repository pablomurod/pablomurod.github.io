<h2>EARLY YEARS</h2>
<p>I grew up in a small town in Madrid, Spain, not far from the Guadarrama Mountains and the (gorgeous) Royal Site of San Lorenzo de El Escorial. I attended a state primary school and a state secondary school, both with notable success. As I remember it now, I was very young when I decided I wanted to be a biologist. It would not be easy nor would it make me rich, but nonetheless I followed my instincts and enrolled in a Biology degree at Autonomous University of Madrid. In the final years, and with most fellow students leaning towards a career on biomedicine or biotechnogy, my interests carried me down the botany route. I completed my biology degree back in 2010 and, one year later, a Masters in Biodiversity from the same university.</p>
<p>By the time I completed my Masters, I had decided I wanted to do a PhD. However, that proved to be a difficult thing to do... in Spain. If I were to enrol in a PhD experience, it had to include a salary. I thus spent three years applying to grants and scholarships from different Spanish organisms and foundations, with little success. Not that my CV wasn't impressive (<b>it wasn't</b>), but my marks were not extra-terrestrial —as the Spanish government seemed to require those days to access a scholarship. My marks were above average, I believe, but still insuficient. Luckily enough, in parallel to submitting unsuccessful applications, I had the opportunity to participate in <a class="text" href="projects.html"><strong>several projects of conservation biology and data management</strong></a> that allowed me to start gaining professional experience.</p>
<p>In 2013, I realised it would be impossible to do a PhD in Spain, so I started looking for options abroad. Long story short, I was finally offered a PhD position at Oxford, more specifically in the Interdisciplinary Biosciences Doctoral Training Partnership programme, a four-year programme with eight weeks of taught classes and a 3-month internship.</p>

<h2>THE D.PHIL.</h2>
<p>I arrived in Oxford on 29th September, 2014. I wrote about that, in Spanish, <a class="text" href="https://editorialsapereaude.com/libro/relatos-de-el-trueno-dorado_52318/" target="_blank"><strong>in a book published a few years later (ask me if you want to know more!)</strong></a>. As I mentioned above, I joined the <a class="text" href="http://www.biodtp.ox.ac.uk/" target="_blank"><strong>Interdisciplinary BioDTP programme</strong></a>, a four-year programme that includes three months of taught classes, two rotation projects (three months each), an internship —which I did at the <a class="text" href="https://cipotato.org/" target="_blank"><strong>International Potato Center</strong></a> in Lima, Peru— and, of course, a doctoral research.</p>
<p>In Oxford, a PhD is called a D.Phil., <i>Doctor Philosophiæ</i>. I did my D.Phil. at the Department of Plant Sciences, a beautiful early 20th century building in central Oxford, under the supervision of <a class="text" href="https://www.plants.ox.ac.uk/people/robert-scotland" target="_blank"><strong>Robert Scotland</strong></a>, then lecturer and now Professor of Systematic Botany. My thesis focused on the systematics of the genus <i>Ipomoea</i> and on the origin and evolution of the sweet potato, <i>Ipomoea batatas</i> (L.) Lam. I submitted it in October 2018 and defended it two months later. I was granted leave to supplicate from University of Oxford on January 2019, which proudly made me the first Doctor in my family.</p>
<p>Alongside my work on <i>Ipomoea</i> and the sweet potato, during those four years I was very lucky to participate in numerous activities of science communication and outreach. In addition, I traveled to several countries (Peru, USA, France, China) to do field work, learn new techniques or attend seminars and conferences. Overall, I believe the 2014-2018 period was the most successful and one of the most profitable times of my professional career and, not least, of my personal life.</p>

<h2>PRESENT</h2>
<p>The work I conducted in Oxford during my doctoral studies largely exceeded the content of the thesis I submitted. This turned out to be very important, as it provided the basis of a project proposal submitted to the British Biotechnology and Biological Research Council (BBSRC). And we were, indeed, successful, obtaining a three-year project that is now the core of my postdoctoral research, also at Oxford. <a class="text" href="http://www.ipomoeaproject.org" target="_blank" title="Ipomoea Project website"><strong>Stay tuned for forthcoming results!</strong></a></p><br />
<p>In 2020, the Consortium of European Taxonomic Facilities awarded me the first <a class="text" href="https://www.plants.ox.ac.uk/article/pablo-munoz-rodriguez-awarded-very-first-cetf-e-score-award#/" target="_blank" title="E-SCoRe award news"><strong>E-SCoRe award</strong> for excellence in research based on natural science collections</a>. I am president of <a class="text" href="http://www.systass.org" target="_blank" title="The Systematics Association website"><strong>The Systematics Association</strong></a> since November 2021 and until November 2024.</p>
