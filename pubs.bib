	abstract = {Calcium oxalate crystal macropatterns in leaves were characterized for 69 species (and two Glycine tomentella cytotypes) from 14 of 16 genera in two legume groups, Glycine and Shuteria, to determine whether they share a common macropattern. A leaf clearing method was used to visualize the crystals. All 69 species (and two Glycine tomentella cytotypes) displayed prismatic crystals associated with leaf veins and vein endings. In contrast, mesophyll crystals occurred in 76.8\% of 69 species and two G. tomentella cytotypes, and varied from a few to many. Conversely, only 40.9\% of 22 Glycine species (in group Glycine) lacked mesophyll crystals, while 8.7\% of 23 species of six genera associated with Glycine (in group Glycine) lacked mesophyll crystals. Thus 24.4\% of 45 species of seven combined genera in group Glycine lacked mesophyll crystals. With seven genera in group Shuteria, 20.8\% of 24 species lacked mesophyll crystals. The consistently present vein crystals varied in size and shape, so their length–width (Stubby versus Long) crystal ratios were determined for primary, secondary, and tertiary veins, and vein endings. Two trends were evident: Long-crystal ratios increased from primary veins to vein endings in species in both groups, and the perennial and annual Glycine species showed this condition to a greater extent than all the non-Glycine species. In some cases, taxonomically closely associated species were quite similar in their macropattern and presence or absence of mesophyll crystals. These results should be of value to future studies dealing with taxonomy and phylogeny of species in these two leguminous groups.},

	abstract = {Via LM and SEM, we studied wood structure of 51 genera representing 19 tribes of Acalyphoideae, the largest subfamily of Euphorbiaceae. Many acalyphoid woods possess the following features: growth rings indistinct or weakly defined; pores evenly distributed; simple perforation plates (but admixture of irregular scalariform plates common); alternate intervessel pits; vessel-ray pits larger than intervessel pits, circular to elongate and alternate to irregular; thin to moderately thick-walled non-septate fibre-tracheids or libriform wood fibres; parenchyma distribution diffuse, diffuse-in-aggregates, and scanty paratracheal, sometimes in thin-tangential bands; heterocellular rays seldom more than 3 cells wide; and prismatic crystals in parenchyma and /or ray cells. Within this syndrome, a number of other wood characters also occur but at lower frequency. For the most part, the unusual features have not proven systematically informative at the tribal level. Presence of lysigenous radial canals, however, supports recognition of tribe Alchorneae. Wood data do not support the segregation of Peraceae and Pandaceae from subfamily Acalyphoideae.},

	copyright = {All rights reserved},
	abstract = {Big genera represent a significant proportion of the world’s plants. However, comprehensive taxonomic and evolutionary studies of these genera are often complicated by their size and geographic spread. This paper explores the challenges faced in classifying these megadiverse plant groups consequent to the existing tension between diagnosability and increasing levels of resolution from molecular sequence data. We use recent examples from across Angiosperms to illustrate how monophyly, diagnosability and completeness interplay with each other in attempts to classify several big genera and, specifically, the genus Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae). Ipomoea and the tribe Ipomoeeae have been the object of recent taxonomic and phylogenetic studies that highlight the limitations of previous attempts to classify the group, and show that the smaller segregate genera traditionally recognised in Ipomoeeae are nested within Ipomoea and are neither monophyletic nor diagnosable. We argue that existing classifications must be abandoned, and that recognising an expanded Ipomoea that incorporates all segregate genera of the Ipomoeeae is the most appropriate solution as it reconciles the properties of monophyly, diagnosability and completeness, and favours nomenclatural stability.},

            The World Checklist of Vascular Plants (WCVP) is a comprehensive list of scientifically described plant species, compiled over four decades, from peer-reviewed literature, authoritative scientific databases, herbaria and observations, then reviewed by experts. It is a vital tool to facilitate plant diversity research, conservation and effective management, including sustainable use and equitable sharing of benefits. To maximise utility, such lists should be accessible, explicitly evidence-based, transparent, expert-reviewed, and regularly updated, incorporating new evidence and emerging scientific consensus. WCVP largely meets these criteria, being continuously updated and freely available online. Users can browse, search, or download a user-defined subset of accepted species with corresponding synonyms and bibliographic details, or a date-stamped full dataset. To facilitate appropriate data reuse by individual researchers and global initiatives including Global Biodiversity Information Facility, Catalogue of Life and World Flora Online, we document data collation and review processes, the underlying data structure, and the international data standards and technical validation that ensure data quality and integrity. We also address the questions most frequently received from users.},

	abstract = {Este juego de datos recoge la Lista de Táxones de la Flora Vascular Española presentada como una tabla adaptada al formato estándar Darwin Core. Comprende las especies y subespecies de flora vascular presentes en la Península Ibérica, Islas Baleares e Islas Canarias, además de sus géneros y familias correspondientes (no se han incluido híbridos). Incluye un total de 10.489 taxones dispuestos en 212 familias, 1399 géneros, 7069 especies y 1813 subespecies. Para su elaboración se ha utilizado como fuente primaria Flora iberica (http://www.floraiberica.es) y ha sido completada con taxones mencionados en la legislación (Atlas y Libros Rojos), así como otras obras donde se recogen taxones canarios, alóctonos u otros aún no tratados por esta obra (ver apartado Citations). Operativamente se entiende que un taxon es un nombre científico con una descripción que lo circunscribe, en este caso, las descripciones vienen referidas por la referencia bibliográfica de las obras (floras, monografías, artículos) que las contienen, no obstante 826 se encuentran provisionalmente sin referencia. Todos los táxones, nombres y referencias bibliográficas vienen acompañadas de sus respectivos identificadores que son de tipo LSID (Life Science Identifiers), y por tanto son únicos, globales, persistentes y resolvibles. Para la asignación de los LSID de nombres científicos se ha utilizado IPNI (http://www.ipni.org). En los casos en que IPNI registra más de una entrada para el mismo nombre (incluido el protólogo), se ha elegido el identificador de la entrada más completa o con menos errores. En caso de discrepancia entre los autores de los nombres científicos entre IPNI y Flora iberica, se ha seguido el criterio de Flora iberica y mantenido el LSID de IPNI. Cuando un nombre no se ha encontrado en IPNI se le ha generado un identificador utilizando el servidor de LSID de GBIF.ES, que llevan de prefijo «urn:lsid:recibio.net:name:». Para la taxonomía se ha seguido en lo posible a Flora iberica (incluyendo las listadas como «Especies que han de buscarse») y subsidiariamente el proyecto Anthos (http://www.anthos.es/). Estas fuentes se han completado con otras atendiendo a criterios de coherencia, relevancia y actualidad.},

Acalypha amithii is morphologically close to the Mesoamerican A. ferdinandi and the South American A. stenoloba. However, it can be distinguished from the former by number of teeth in the bracts of the pistillate flowers (13–15 vs. 7 in the new species) and from the latter by the degree of fusion of the sepals of the pistillate flowers (connate at the base vs. free in the new species). Acalypha amithii is characterized by a suffruticose habit, penninerved leaves, terminal or axillary pistillate inflorescences, sepals of the pistillate flowers completely free and ovate-lanceolate, bracts of the pistillate flowers cuneate at the base, styles glabrous and almost 12 times longer than the ovary.},

Basándose en la evaluación de los sistemas reproductivos y las características florales en el contexto de los resultados filogenéticos, estimamos 16 derivaciones independientes de la autogamia y cuatro reversiones a la xenogamía. Las transiciones a la autogamia se asocian con relaciones bajas de polen/óvulo, la disminución de la distancia entre las anteras y el estigma, y corolas pequeñas.

	abstract = {Ipomoea trifida (H. B. K.) G. Don. is the most likely diploid ancestor of the hexaploid sweet potato, I. batatas (L.) Lam. To assist in analysis of the sweet potato genome, de novo whole-genome sequencing was performed with two lines of I. trifida, namely the selfed line Mx23Hm and the highly heterozygous line 0431-1, using the Illumina HiSeq platform. We classified the sequences thus obtained as either 'core candidates' (common to the two lines) or 'line specific'. The total lengths of the assembled sequences of Mx23Hm (ITR\_r1.0) was 513 Mb, while that of 0431-1 (ITRk\_r1.0) was 712 Mb. Of the assembled sequences, 240 Mb (Mx23Hm) and 353 Mb (0431-1) were classified into core candidate sequences. A total of 62,407 (62.4 Mb) and 109,449 (87.2 Mb) putative genes were identified, respectively, in the genomes of Mx23Hm and 0431-1, of which 11,823 were derived from core sequences of Mx23Hm, while 28,831 were from the core candidate sequence of 0431-1. There were a total of 1,464,173 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 16,682 copy number variations (CNVs) in the two assembled genomic sequences (under the condition of log2 ratio of {\textgreater}1 and CNV size {\textgreater}1,000 bases).

The FISH data obtained indicated that polyploidization was followed by decrease in the number of 18S rDNA loci in higher ploidy level and provided evidence for major genomic rearrangements and/or diploidization in polyploid I. batatas. Among the five diploid species examined, I. trifida appeared to be the most closely related to I. batatas. By contrast, I. leucantha was closed to I. tiliacea, but both species were distant from sweet potato. I. triloba and I. setosa were distantly related to the rest of Ipomoea batatas complex. The close relationship between I. trifida and I. batatas was also demonstrated by the presence of one 18S and CMA marker in these two chromosome complements only. Based on chromosome morphology, tetraploid I. trifida appeared to be more closely related to sweet potato than I. tabascana. Taking all data obtained in this study, I. trifida might be the progenitor of I. batatas, and I. tabascana, interspecific hybrid between these two species. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

This collection contains tetraploids from a wide geographic range and most were tentatively identified by the collector as I. trifida. This study shows that corolla and sepal traits may be used to distinguish the tetraploids from known specimens of I. trifida (diploid) and I. batatas (hexaploid). All but one tetraploid accession examined (CH67.50) had corolla tubes and sepals shaped like I. batatas and more closely resembled that species than I. trifida. Use of corolla tube diameter allowed the hexaploid I. batatas and tetraploid accessions to be distinguished from I. trifida because the corolla tubes were wider immediately above the calyx. Differences in sepal shape were quantified using the angle at the sepal apex. This angle was consistently obtuse in the I. batatas hexaploids and the tetraploids, but was acute in the I. trifida accessions. Due to similarities in sepal and corolla traits, these tetraploids should be re-identified as tetraploid I. batatas, a cytological race of the hexaploid I. batatas (the sweetpotato).},

These species, I. leucantha (2x), I. littoralis (4x) and I. trifida (6x), are the progenitors of the sweet potato (6x), in an autopolyploid series with doubling of the I. leucantha B genome. In the present study the hypothesis of the origin of the sweet potato was confirmed by comparative studies on some plant characters, sexual compatibility, and the behavior of artificial hexaploids produced from I. leucantha (2x) and I. littoralis (4x). Since induced hexaploid I. leucantha exhibits weak growth, a few multivalents are formed at meiosis in the sweet potato, and there are differences in morphological and physiological characteristics between the artificial hexaploids and I. batatas, raw autoploidy seems unlikely, but a balanced or diploidised autoploidy could have been achieved by genic and chromosomal changes in the course of evolution. However, there is still sufficient homology so that meiotic pairing occurs usually between regular partners but also between homoeologous chromosomes in a certain situation.},

	abstract = {The discovery of a direct ancestor, Ipomoea trifida (6x), of the sweet potato (6x) in 1961-1962 has been followed by a further finding of its diploid (I, leucantha) and tetraploid (I. littoralis) predecessors. On the basis of cytogenetical study it was reasonably assumed that I. littoralis (4x), I. trifida-(3x)-6x, I. trifida (6x) and I. batatas (6x), sweet potato, are autoploids derived rather from the doubling of a set of 15 chromosome pairs (genome B) of I. leucantha (2x) than from segmental alloploidy. On the other hand an artificial hexaploid, I. littocantha, synthesized from I. leucantha (2x) and I. littoralis (4x) was proved to have the same genome constitution as I. trifida-(3x)-6x and sweet potato, their Fl hybrids having 45 bivalents or modified configurations. The hybrids were fertile. Another artificial hexaploid, I, lacuno-cilis, derived from I. lacunosa (2x) and I. gracilis (4x) was self-fertile, but usually did not hybridize either with I. trifida or sweet potato. The phylogenetic relationship was fairly well supported by the pattern of the mat-ing system in interspecific crosses. A hexaploid wild form of Ipomoea was collected by the author in Mexico in 1955. It was found to represent I. trifida (H.B.K.) Don. Based on the morphological, cytological and genetical evidences, this wild plant was considered to be the direct progenitor of the sweet potato, I. batatas (L.) Lam. (Nishiyama, 1961; Nishiyama et al., 1961a, b; Nishiyama and Teramura, 1962). It goes without saying that it corres-ponded very well to our long known conception of an ancestral type of sweet potato. The close relationship was confirmed by Jones (1967) on the evidence of crossing experiments and cytological observations of F1 hybrids between sweet potato and the wild form. On the other hand, as already reported by some workers, Jones also found that some sweet-potato seedlings exhibited occasionally such wild characteristics as nonedible roots, winding or climbing habit stems and pubescence on stems, petioles, peduncles and leaves. These findings have led him to a different conclusion from ours, namely that I. trifida (K123) is not an ancestor but a segregate of the sweet potato.

	abstract = {The results of intensive meiotic studies, particularly of the karyology and chromosomal homology at the pachytene stage, in the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.), which is a hexaploid (2 n = 90), have thrown considerable light on its origin and genome relationships. Using suitable criteria, such as relative length of chromosomes, centromere position, chromomere pattern, absence of light staining segments in one of the arms, presence of telochromomere etc., 40 of the 45 haploid chromosome complement at pachytene were identified and assigned to 19 chromosomal types. Among these types, eight were present singly; in six of the types, chromosomes were present in duplicate, and in two types, in triplicate. The occurrence of higher multivalent chromosomal associations such as hexavalents and pentavalents, in addition to the quadrivalents already reported, was recorded for the first time at the pachytene and metaphase I stages. The hexavalents at pachytene were resolved into three distinct types based on the morphology of the participating chromosomes. A maximum number of nine quadrivalents at the metaphase I stage and four in the incompletely analyzed pachytene nuclei were recorded. The constituent chromosomes of three of the quadrivalents at pachytene stage were identified. From these observations, it is suggested that (i) the three parental genomes are partly homologous (ii) two of the genomes show closer homology to one another than to the third and (iii) the three genomes differ with respect to one or more of the eight chromosomal types occurring singly. The available information rules out an autopolyploid origin for sweet potato and suggests that the parental genomes are from closely related taxa. The advantages are emphasized of pursuing similar studies in other American Ipomoea species to unravel their relationship with the sweet potato. Among other meiotic irregularities, a translocated chromosome and a chromosome carrying inversion were detected at the pachytene stage and the possible role they may play in varietal differentiation is discussed.},

Despite this, research along cytological lines on this crop and its related species has been much neglected. Chromosome numbers of many species of the genus \textit{Ipomoea} have not yet been determined, and few varieties of commercial sweet potatoes have been cytologically analyzed. The superior pioneer works of Kano (1929), Walcott (1937), King and Bamford (1937), and Rao (1947) have provided much valuable information concerning chromosome numbers to research staffs working on sweet potato improvement, but more is needed. It is astonishing that the first meiotic study of the sweet potato itself was not published until 1953 (Ting and Kehr, 1953). The present study was undertaken with the objective of examining the meiotic features in various varieties of the sweet potato plant, and deter- mining the chromosome numbers of the other species in the genus Ipomoea. Particular attention was paid to those species which are taxonomically closely placed to the sweet potato plant. In addition, an interspecific hy- bridization program was initiated in order to clarify the phylogenetic relationship between the sweet potato plant and the other species in the genus.},

	abstract = {Archaeological evidence indicates that pig domestication had begun by ∼10,500 y before the present (BP) in the Near East, and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) suggests that pigs arrived in Europe alongside farmers ∼8,500 y BP. A few thousand years after the introduction of Near Eastern pigs into Europe, however, their characteristic mtDNA signature disappeared and was replaced by haplotypes associated with European wild boars. This turnover could be accounted for by substantial gene flow from local European wild boars, although it is also possible that European wild boars were domesticated independently without any genetic contribution from the Near East. To test these hypotheses, we obtained mtDNA sequences from 2,099 modern and ancient pig samples and 63 nuclear ancient genomes from Near Eastern and European pigs. Our analyses revealed that European domestic pigs dating from 7,100 to 6,000 y BP possessed both Near Eastern and European nuclear ancestry, while later pigs possessed no more than 4\% Near Eastern ancestry, indicating that gene flow from European wild boars resulted in a near-complete disappearance of Near East ancestry. In addition, we demonstrate that a variant at a locus encoding black coat color likely originated in the Near East and persisted in European pigs. Altogether, our results indicate that while pigs were not independently domesticated in Europe, the vast majority of human-mediated selection over the past 5,000 y focused on the genomic fraction derived from the European wild boars, and not on the fraction that was selected by early Neolithic farmers over the first 2,500 y of the domestication process.},

Due to its high ploidy level, genetic studies in sweetpotato lag behind major diploid crops significantly. We built an ultra-dense multilocus integrated genetic map and characterized the inheritance system in a sweetpotato full-sib family using our newly implemented software, MAPpoly. The resulting genetic map revealed 96.5\% collinearity between I. batatas and its diploid relative I. trifida. We computed the genotypic probabilities across the whole genome for all individuals in the mapping population and inferred their complete hexaploid haplotypes. We provide evidence that most of the meiotic configurations (73.3\%) were resolved in bivalents, although a small portion of multivalent signatures (15.7\%), among other inconclusive configurations (11.0\%) were also observed. Except for low levels of preferential pairing in linkage group 2, we observed a hexasomic inheritance mechanism in all linkage groups. We propose that the hexasomic-bivalent inheritance promotes stability to the allelic transmission in sweetpotato.},

The lack of genomic resources could affect the process of industrialization of sweet potato. Few detailed reports have been completed on the mitochondrial genome of sweet potato. In this research, we sequenced and assembled the mitochondrial genome of sweet potato and investigated its substructure. The mitochondrial genome of sweet potato is 270,304 bp with 23 unique core genes and 12 variable genes. We detected 279 pairs of repeat sequences and found that three pairs of direct repeats could mediate the homologous recombination into four independent circular molecules. We identified 70 SSRs in the whole mitochondrial genome of sweet potato. The longest dispersed repeat in mitochondrial genome was a palindromic repeat with a length of 915 bp. The homologous fragments between the chloroplast and mitochondrial genome account for 7.35\% of the mitochondrial genome. We also predicted 597 RNA editing sites and found that the rps3 gene was edited 54 times, which occurred most frequently. This study further demonstrates the existence of multiple conformations in sweet potato mitochondrial genomes and provides a theoretical basis for the evolution of higher plants and cytoplasmic male sterility breeding.},

It recruits organelle-associated reads using a modified “baiting and iterative mapping” approach, conducts de novo assembly, filters and disentangles the assembly graph, and produces all possible configurations of circular organelle genomes. For 50 published plant datasets, we are able to reassemble the circular plastomes from 47 datasets using GetOrganelle. GetOrganelle assemblies are more accurate than published and/or NOVOPlasty-reassembled plastomes as assessed by mapping. We also assemble complete mitochondrial genomes using GetOrganelle.

Taxonomic species are presented as the products of a cyclic workflow between taxonomists and biologists in general, and as the essential means to express the results of evolutionary biological research in a cognitive form which can be widely understood outside the systematics research community. In the first part, the procedures underlying the formation and structure of classical species taxon concepts are analysed and discussed, and this involves some passing reference to mental concepts as understood by cognitive psychologists. The second part considers the need for methodological advances in classical taxonomy in the form of computational modelling. It is argued that in order to accomplish this, species taxon concepts will need to be expressed as computable matrices in parallel to their conventional form, expanding their role in integrative taxonomy, facilitating the feedback from evolutionary biological research and potentially accelerating the update and modification of their delimitation as knowledge increases. The third part treats another, more immediate methodological issue: some kinds of data already produced by taxonomic revisions could be provided as standard online outputs but are not yet part of the canonical published format. The final part consists of a discussion of the gradually emerging global online framework of taxonomic species and its importance as a general reference system. A glossary of terms is provided.},

Fundamental questions regarding where, when, and how many times domestication took place have been of primary interest within a wide range of academic disciplines. Within the last two decades, the advent of new archaeological and genetic techniques has revolutionized our understanding of the pattern and process of domestication and agricultural origins that led to our modern way of life. In the spring of 2011, 25 scholars with a central interest in domestication representing the fields of genetics, archaeobotany, zooarchaeology, geoarchaeology, and archaeology met at the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center to discuss recent domestication research progress and identify challenges for the future. In this introduction to the resulting Special Feature, we present the state of the art in the field by discussing what is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of domestication, and controversies surrounding the speed, intentionality, and evolutionary aspects of the domestication process. We then highlight three key challenges for future research. We conclude by arguing that although recent progress has been impressive, the next decade will yield even more substantial insights not only into how domestication took place, but also when and where it did, and where and why it did not.},

Choosing an appropriate cpDNA region for phylogenetic investigation is difficult because of the scarcity of information about the tempo of evolutionary rates among different noncoding cpDNA regions. The focus of this investigation was to determine whether there is any predictable rate heterogeneity among 21 noncoding cpDNA regions identified as phylogenetically useful at low levels. To test for rate heterogeneity among the different cpDNA regions, we used three species from each of 10 groups representing eight major phylogenetic lineages of phanerogams. The results of this study clearly show that a survey using as few as three representative taxa can be predictive of the amount of phylogenetic information offered by a cpDNA region and that rate heterogeneity exists among noncoding cpDNA regions.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Naturally occurring and semisynthetic ergot alkaloids play a role in health care or as recreational drugs in Western and indigenous Mexican societies. Evidence is summarized that ergot alkaloids present in Central American Convolvulaceae like Turbina corymbosa, Ipomoea violacea, and Ipomoea asarifolia are colonized by different species of a newly described clavicipitaceous fungal genus named Periglandula. The fungi are associated with peltate glandular trichomes on the adaxial leaf surface of its host plants. The Periglandula fungi are not yet culturable in vitro but were demonstrated to have the capacity to synthesize ergot alkaloids. The alkaloids do not remain in the fungal mycelium but are translocated via the glandular trichomes into their plant host. Both fungi and host benefit from a symbiotic lifestyle. In evolutionary terms the alkaloid biosynthetic gene cluster in the Periglandula/Ipomoea symbiosis is likely to have a conserved (basic) structure while biosynthetic ergot gene clusters within the genera Claviceps and Epichloe were under ecological selection for alkaloid diversification.},

	abstract = {Lianas are woody climbing plants that begin their life cycles as seedlings rooted in the ground, but eventually rely on other plants for physical support in order to reach the top of the forest canopy (Holbrook \& Putz 1996, Putz \& Holbrook 1991). Lianas can negatively affect plants they climb by competing with them for common resources such as light, water and nutrients, and by causing them direct physical damage (Dillenburg
              et al.
              1995, Pérez-Salicrup \& Barker 2000, Stevens 1987, Whigham 1984). Yet, there is little documentation about the size at which liana individuals of different species begin to climb on other plants in nature. This information is important because the size at which a liana begins to climb on other plants will determine when lianas potentially start physically affecting their supporting plants. Furthermore, although the growth of liana seedlings might be determined by light (Sanches \& Válio 2002), the availability of support will also largely influence the rate of growth of liana stems (Peñalosa 1982, 1983, 1985). Thus, information about the size at which liana species find support in the forest understorey will be useful in understanding future growth of liana individuals.},

	abstract = {Pollen, biogenic silica and starch residue analyses of soils from archaeological stonework complexes in South Auckland, northern New Zealand, reveal evidence of palaeo-environments and vegetation, including agricultural crops. A broad sampling strategy involving minimal disturbance to features was used (35 composite soil samples from six sites) to determine the extent to which the complexes were used for agriculture, identifying specific crops and pinpointing areas for subsequent intensive excavation. Starch and other residues of Ipomoea batatas (sweet potato) and Colocasia esculenta (taro), introduced by prehistoric Polynesians, were identified in a range of stonefield features at four sites. Zea mays (maize), an early European introduction, was identified at two sites. The study also highlights problems of downward displacement and preservation of plant microfossils in dryland soils. The data represent initial extensive, multi-microfossil analysis of archaeological stonework complexes.},

	abstract = {Manioc (Manihot esculenta), a food plant of American origin, is not generally thought to have been introduced to the Pacific Islands until the mid-nineteenth century. However, a book published recently in Madrid has revealed hitherto unknown evidence that manioc was reported on Easter Island in 1770 by members of a Spanish expedition from Peru. The term they used for it was yuca, a word borrowed into Peruvian Spanish from Quechua. Many of the documents reproduced in the new book had not previously been published in their original Spanish, although early this century the most significant documents were translated into English and published in volumes of the Hakluyt Society. However, the English translator concealed or obfuscated the evidence on manioc. In one instance he rendered the word yuca as taro; in three others he left it untranslated, adding an erroneous footnote in one case. This paper argues that, in the climate of his times, the translator acted as he did because, simply, he could not believe that manioc would have been present on Easter Island in 1770. It also argues that the evidence greatly strengthens the case for prehistoric American Indian influence on Easter Island and other islands of eastern Polynesia.},

	abstract = {The PhD entitled “Last 70kyr of Rano Aroi (Easter Island, 27ºS) peat record: New insights for Central Pacific paleoclimatology” presents an environmental and climate reconstruction of Easter Island during the last 70.000 years. To accomplish this purpose, two peat cores of 14 and 4 meters have been retrieved from the center and the margin of the Rano Aroi peatland. Facies description and age model allowed us to decipher that the peat started accumulating 70.000 years ago, what means that this is the oldest peat record recovered up to the moment over the Southern Pacific. To investigate changes in the type of accumulated peat we determined total carbon, nitrogen and sulfur (TC, TN, TS) of organic matter as well as stable isotope values of each element (delta13C, delta15N, delta34S). In order to decipher the composition of the mineral content, X-Ray Fluorescence measurements was performed over the cores, obtaining the quantity of Ca, Fe and Ti. Additionally, the concentration of the major, minor and trace elements was determined by spectrometry (ICP-AES). The geochemical approach was complemented by the study of macrofossil (plant or animal remains as seeds or insects) and pollen content, what permitted to reconstruct vegetation changes on the mire and the island. The combination of geochemical and biological proxies defined three main hydric conditions (flood, drought and baseline conditions) of the peatland that have been alternated along Late Pleistocene and Holocene. During MIS 4 (70 to 60 kyr BP in Rano Aroi), the hydric and environmental conditions in the mire were stable and resembled mire baseline conditions. Open grasslands covered Rano Aroi catchment area and C4 Poaceae dominated the mire. Early MIS 3 (60 to 40 cal kyr BP in Rano Aroi) was marked by the onset of wet events. During the first half of MIS 3 and probably driven by the wetter and warmer conditions Asteraceae and other small trees became gradually more abundant, forming small and scattered forests around the Terevaka volcano, while C3 peat forming plants colonized the Aroi mire. Late MIS 3 was a very dry period, which led to peat oxidation and exposure shortly after 39 cal kyr BP. These conditions changed on early MIS 2 (27.8–19 cal kyr BP). The water table recovered and peat accumulation resumed under C3 plant dominance. The evidence of the onset of deglaciation is concordant with Raraku Lake environmental development and was dated at 17.5 cal kyr BP in both sites. The regional mid-Holocene dry period is well characterized at Rano Aroi from 5 to 2.5 cal kyr BP. The correlation between Rano Aroi record and other circumpacific sites suggests important changes in the atmospheric or oceanic circulation on Central Pacific during Late Pleistocene. In particular, the Rano Aroi record indicates that the episodes of maximum precipitation over the island correlate with North Atlantic Heinrich stadials and other stadials. During these stadials, the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) migrated to the south while the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) shifted eastwards provoking the arrival of storm systems over the island. In accordance to this atmospheric and oceanic restructuration, Rano Aroi wet events also correlated with periods of a reduced Sea Surface Temperature (SST) gradient along the Equator. This fact indicates that more humid conditions over the Easter Island region occurred when the Walker circulation was reduced. The Central Pacific climate was also influenced by high latitude dynamics, like the changes in Intermediate Antarctic Water formation and the position of the Southern Westerlies.},

Desde então, devido à dificuldade no reconhecimento das espécies pelo expressivo polimorfismo, o gênero tem acumulado uma série de problemas taxonômicos tais quais sinonímias. Este estudo teve como principal objetivo revisar o gênero no Brasil, além de incluir análises palinológicas, moleculares e biogeográficas para buscar responder questões de demilitação infragenérica. Dos 58 nomes reconhecidos na Flora do Brasil (Bianchini \& Ferreira 2012), apenas 42 foram considerados aqui. No total, o Brasil apresenta 50 espécies de Jacquemontia, atendendo as novas espécies e novos sinônimos aqui indicados. Tanto dados polínicos quanto moleculares demonstraram que as seções estabelecidas para o gênero com base exclusivamente na morfologia das inflorescências, não compõem grupos naturais. Dados de distribuição demonstraram que a maioria das espécies brasileiras apresentam um padrão de distribuição restrito, e que o centro de riqueza de endemismos no Brasil está na Cadeia do Espinhaço. Sugerindo assim, o apoio a políticas conservacionistas na área para a conservação do patrimônio genético de Jacquemontia.},

	abstract = {A comprehensive systematic monograph is presented for the genus Operculina Silva Manso (Convolvulaceae). Formerly included in tribe Merremieae D. F. Austin, now incertae sedis, recent systematic studies have clarified the phylogenetic relationships for Operculina and unequivocally demonstrated that it is monophyletic as currently circumscribed and that the unique operculate capsule is a synapomorphy for the genus. Other morphological characters useful for recognizing the genus are: large sepals forming a “pear-shaped” calyx that is broad at the base and tapers upward; calyx that is accrescent and persistent, often cupping the mature fruit; strongly spirally coiled anthers after dehiscence; and axial parts of the plant body (stems, petioles, peduncles, pedicels) that are often prominently winged. The current monograph accepts 13 species, including one variety and one purported hybrid; these taxa are distributed throughout the tropics globally. The hybrid is proposed to accommodate the extraordinary phenotypic variability and intermediacy among South Pacific populations of Operculina. The monograph provides detailed descriptions for all taxa, as well as an identification key, distribution maps, and summaries of ecology, phenology, vernacular names, and uses, with comments on synonymy, typification, variability, biology, and conservation, where appropriate. All names published or combined in Operculina (about 60 epithets) are accounted for as accepted names, synonyms, misapplied names, or uncertain names, or are excluded from the genus. New reductions to synonymy are proposed as follows: O. brownii Ooststr. becomes a synonym of O. codonantha (Benth.) Hallier f.; O. tansaensis Santapau \& V. Patel becomes a synonym of O. ventricosa (Bertero) Peter. Lectotypes, neotypes, and epitypes are designated where necessary to stabilize names in current use.

	abstract = {Uganda is the largest producer of sweetpotato in Africa. Sweetpotato is an important crop that fits well in the country’s farming and food systems. In cultivated area, sweetpotato ranks third after bananas and cassava. It stores well in the soil as a famine reserve crop, withstands extreme weather conditions, and performs well in marginal soils. Because sweetpotato is grown virtually in all areas of the country, it plays an important role in providing household food security. In some households, sweetpotato generates cash income in addition to being a food source. A typical household owns a sweetpotato plot of less than one acre and cultivates more than five varieties, each identified by a name in the local language. Most varieties have different maturation periods, indicative of farmers’ desires for a yera-round supply of sweetpotato. Despite the demonstrated importance of sweetpotato, its production still faces several biological, physical, and socioeconomic constraints. Of major importance are the absence of high-yielding and disease-resistant planting materials, poor agronomic practices, lack of markets, unavailability of farm inputs, the high cost of existing inputs, poor storage facilities, limited use opportunities, and infestations of insect and vertebrate pests. This was established after a sweetpotato baseline survey that was conducted in Uganda between 1989 and 1992.},

	abstract = {Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) was originally domesticated in tropical America. The sweetpotato gene bank maintained at CIP now contains 5526 cultivated accessions from 57 countries, of which 2589 are from Latin America. Understanding the diversity in the distribution of this germplasm is essential for its rational management and use. In the present study, we ana- lyzed a group of sweetpotato varieties from Latin America using simple-sequence repeat (SSR) markers. Twelve SSR primer pairs with di- nucleotide tandem repeats were screened. Six primer pairs that generated scorable allelic information were used to type the 113 varieties. The six SSR loci revealed a total of 70 alleles, with allele size ranging from 102 base pairs to 173. Both the richness and the evenness of the alleles show a significant geographical pattern in the Latin American sweetpotato gene pool. Mesoamerica ranks the highest in terms of total number of alleles, number of region-specific alleles, and actual heterozygosity, whereas the region of Peru- Ecuador ranks the lowest on all three counts. This, together with our earlier findings based on AFLP analysis, strongly supports the hypothesis that Mesoamerica is the primary center of diversity and most likely the center of origin of the sweetpotato. Peru-Ecuador should be considered as a secondary center of sweetpotato diversity. The tetrasomic inheritance of these SSRs also supports the hypothesis that sweetpotato is an alloautohexaploid with two non-homologous genomes.},

The dendrogram obtained using phenotypic characters separated the genotypes into two major clusters with a Euclidean distance ranging from 0.0 to 6.98. Twenty three unique alleles, ranging from 3 to 6 per locus were detected using six simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers. Cluster analysis showed a Jaccard co-efficient ranging from 0.5 to 1.0 indicating high genetic diversity. Comparison between morphological and molecular data using the mantel test revealed a low correlation (r = -0.05) between the two data sets. Despite the poor correlation both techniques showed a high degree of variation among the genotypes suggesting great genetic diversity in Kenyan sweet potato genotypes that can be utilized in breeding programs.},

Relatedness amongaccessions was estimated by analyzing the AFLP data using the Dice coefficientof similarity and UPGMA methods. The molecular analysis revealed relativelylimited genetic diversity within and between sites. Genotypes collected in agiven region often displayed molecular marker variability similar to thatobserved over the entire sampled area. However, a subset of 14 genotypes derivedfrom seed collected from New Ireland island differed from genotypes collected onNew Guinea island. Estimates of genetic diversity-based similarity valuescalculated from the AFLP data indicated a moderate level of diversity (0.767mean coefficient of similarity) across all plant materials analyzed. Threemethods of selection were evaluated for their efficacy in capturing themolecular marker diversity within the plant materials in the form of a subset.They were random, stratified-random (geographic based), and marker-assistedselection (MAS). MAS was the most efficient. A Maximally Diverse Subset (MDS) of12 genotypes capturing 92\% of the molecular marker diversity was identified.},

	abstract = {The phenotypic diversity of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) landraces was assessed using morphological traits, verifying how this diversity is distributed among the households and settlements of the Vale do Ribeira, Brazil. A total of 74 accessions, involving 53 landraces, collected from 30 households distributed among 18 settlements that practice traditional agriculture in the municipalities of Iguape, Ilha Comprida, and Cananeia, as well as four commercial varieties acquired in markets of Iguape and Piracicaba, were evaluated under an ex situ experimental condition in Piracicaba, SP, Brazil. Nine phenological and floral descriptors, nine morphological vegetative aerial descriptors and five storage root traits were recorded. The 14 aerial vegetative and root descriptors were evaluated as binary data, totaling 74 attributes. Cluster analyses were made using the Jaccard similarity index and the UPGMA (unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean) agglomerative method. Binary data was also submitted to a variance analysis (AMOVA). No defined groups were observed, indicating that the diversity of the landraces is not structured in space, but considerable morphological variation was found in this area (Jaccard similarity index varying from 0.12 to 1.0). Most of the variability occurred within households (64.4\%), followed by the distribution among households within settlements (27.1\%) and among settlements (8.4\%). Thus, the traditional agriculturists of Vale do Ribeira maintain a high morphological diversity for sweet potato within their households, which can be assumed to be produced by the outcrossing mating system of this species and somatic mutation events, as well as the exchange system at local and regional levels.},

	abstract = {Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas L.) is a nutritious food crop and, based on the high starch content of its storage root, a potential bioethanol feedstock. Enhancing the nutritional value and starch quantity of storage roots are important goals of sweet potato breeding programs aimed at developing improved varieties for direct consumption, processing, and industrial uses. However, developing improved lines of sweet potato is challenging due to the genetic complexity of this plant and the lack of genome information. Short sequence repeat (SSR) markers are powerful molecular tools for tracking important loci in crops and for molecular-based breeding strategies; however, few SSR markers and marker-trait associations have hitherto been identified in sweet potato. In this study, we identified 1824 SSRs by using a de novo assembly of publicly available ESTs and mRNAs in sweet potato, and designed 1476 primer pairs based on SSR-containing sequences. We mapped 214 pairs of primers in a natural population comprised of 239 germplasms, and identified 1278 alleles with an average of 5.972 alleles per locus and a major allele frequency of 0.7702. Population structure analysis revealed two subpopulations in this panel of germplasms, and phenotypic characterization demonstrated that this panel is suitable for association mapping of starch-related traits. We identified 32, 16, and 17 SSR markers associated with starch content, β-carotene content, and starch composition in the storage root, respectively, using association analysis and further evaluation of a subset of sweet potato genotypes with various characteristics. The SSR markers identified here can be used to select varieties with desired traits and to investigate the genetic mechanism underlying starch and carotenoid formation in the starchy roots of sweet potato.},

The main objective of the present study was a comparison of genetic diversity parameters of different ploidy levels (2n, 4n, and 6n codominant allele determination), analyzed on two high-resolution capillary platforms. Fragment analysis was performed by applying SSR markers on a 3130XL Genetic Analyzer (ABI 3130) and QIAxcel Advanced System (QX). A high level of expected heterozygosity (He)as a measure of genetic diversity was observed for both ABI3130 (0.731) and QX (0.679). Molecular variance was 17\% for ABI3130 and 10\% for QX. Comparison between genetic distance matrices based on allele lengths showed a moderate Mantel correlation coefficient(rxy = 0.557) between ABI3130 and QX. Global cluster analysis using the Bayesian approach distributed the observed genotypes into two clusters on both capillary platforms. Our results show that the two high-resolution capillary electrophoreses for codominant data on 2n, 4n,and 6n levels are applicable in genetic diversity studies but their efficiency depends on in-resolution expectations, financial resources, available time, and the equipment of the laboratory.},

The cluster analysis revealed existence of two major groups, 1 and 2 with low genetic variability of 0.52. Number of roots, weight of roots, fresh weight/plant and dry matter content differed significantly among and within agro-ecological zones. Landraces Lubisi from southern highlands zone had the highest number of roots (12 per plant) and Shinamugi from Eastern zone had highest dry matter content of 39.4\%. Overall, landraces from Lake Zone recorded highest average root weight of 8,977.7 kg ha-1 followed by Southern highlands (7,561.2 kg ha-1) and Eastern zone (4,333.0 kg ha-1). Principal coordinate analysis (PCA) indicated variances accumulated by the first five components of the six major morphological characters was 52.5\% and produced similar groups corresponding to those of cluster analysis. Our data indicate low genetic variation despite significant variations shown by agronomical traits. Many landraces recorded in different names from three different agro ecological zones showed close resemblance and grouped into two major groups suggesting presence of dupl-icates or mislabelling.},

All cultivars showed unique fingerprint patterns indicating the utility of DAF in cultivar identification. Many heirloom cultivars such as `Creole' and `Porto Rico' were readily differentiated from recently developed cultivars. Modern cultivars such as `Jewel', `Carver', `Nugget', and `Scarlet' exhibited a high degree of similarity reflecting ancestral relatedness. `Regal' and `Excel', recently developed using a population-based breeding approach, showed greater divergence from all other cultivars. Those cultivars, developed as a result of somatic mutations, exhibited high levels of genetic similarity to their normal-type parents and yet had distinct fingerprint profiles. With few exceptions, genetic relationships derived from DAF data appear to be consistent with available pedigree information.},

The single tegument differentiated into the testa consisting at maturity of 4 coverings: the epidermis, and subepidermis which are single-layered, the sclerenchyma with 3 to 4 layers of cells and a fibrous covering consisting of collapsed parenchyma. The outer layer of the sclerenchyma has a double line light in colour. When mature the endosperm has only 2-3 layers of living cells (aleurone layer) and the remains of the cell walls. The first division of the zygote is transverse. The embryo with its cotyledons occupies the greater part of the mature seed and has many laticifers.},

	abstract = {Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation (GSPC) is, "a widely accessible working list of all known plant species, as a step towards a complete world Flora". This paper discusses the importance of the Target to the GSPC itself, to many sectors of science and society, and to decision makers. It then examines the progress made to date and prospects for the Target's completion. Good progress has been made in bryophytes, ferns and gymnosperms with widely accessible working lists either complete or almost so for these groups. Online working lists are available for around 50\% of flowering plants. In all, Target 1 is around 53\% complete. It is estimated that there are around 352,000 flowering plants and that the current gap in online coverage is around 177,000 species. The major families constituting the gap are identified, the four largest being Apocynaceae, Malvaceae, Ericaceae and Apiaceae. The large majority of families for which there is no working list available are either cosmopolitan or pantropical in distribution. However, progress to date suggests that neither broad distribution nor large numbers of species in a family are insurmountable problems in compiling working lists. The major barrier to completion of Target 1 remains the availability of taxonomists to contribute to the target. Completion of Target 1 by 2010 is possible if botanical institutions recognise the importance of the Target and collaborate, lever funding and prioritise activities appropriately.},

A critical review of this pioneering work points up a basic problem in the structure of analysis. The problem is generated by the use of a simple site taxonomy that is insensitive to the range of human activities that went on at different settlements. Examination of the subsequent course of settlement pattern research shows that this fundamental problem has not been recognized or dealt with in a constructive manner. The small site methodology is introduced as one possible means of treating sites in terms of the different activity patterns they housed.},

	abstract = {We describe a model-based clustering method for using multilocus genotype data to infer population structure and assign individuals to populations. We assume a model in which there are K populations (where K may be unknown), each of which is characterized by a set of allele frequencies at each locus. Individuals in the sample are assigned (probabilistically) to populations, or jointly to two or more populations if their genotypes indicate that they are admixed. Our model does not assume a particular mutation process, and it can be applied to most of the commonly used genetic markers, provided that they are not closely linked. Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci-e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species. The software used for this article is available from http://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/ approximately pritch/home.html.},

	title = {Assembly algorithms for {Next} {Generation} {Sequence} data},
	url = {https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/files/final_submissions/587},
	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing is revolutionizing genomics, promising higher coverage at a lower cost per base when compared to Sanger sequencing. Shorter reads and higher error rates from these new instruments necessitate the development of new algorithms and software. This dissertation describes approaches to tackle some problems related to genome assembly with these short fragments. We describe YASRA (Yet Another Short Read Assembler), that performs comparative assembly of short reads using a reference genome, which can differ substantially from the genome being sequenced. We explain the algorithm and present the results of assembling one ancient-mitochondrial and one plastid dataset. Comparing the performance of YASRA with the AMOScmp-shortReads and Newbler mapping assemblers (version 2.0.00.17) as template genomes are varied, we \&\#64257;nd that YASRA generates fewer contigs with higher coverage and fewer errors. We also analyze situations where the use of comparative assembly outperforms de novo assembly, and vice-versa, and compare the performance of YASRA with that of the Velvet (version 0.7.53) and Newbler de novo assemblers (version 2.0.00.17). We utilize the concept of “overlap-graphs” from YASRA to \&\#64257;nd genetic differences within a target species. We describe a simple pipeline for deducing such locations of variation in the presence of a reference genome and then extend it to deduce polymorphisms in a species without the help of a reference genome. Our implementation of this algorithm, DIAL (De Novo Identi\&\#64257;cation of Alleles) is described. The method works even when the coverage is insuf\&\#64257;cient for de novo assembly and can be extended to determine small indels (insertions/deletions). We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach using published Roche/454 sequence data of Dr. James Watson to detect heterozygous locations. We also apply our approach on recent Illumina data from Orangutan, in each case comparing our results to those from computational analysis that used a reference genome sequence.},

This domestication is associated with the development of Tropical Forest agricultural villages by ca. 2500 B.C. The Spanish introduced it to Europe and spread it to China and Japan and Malaysia and the Moluccas region. The Portuguese carried it to India, Indonesia, and Africa. The plant has a pre-Magellan introduction into Polynesia by possibly A.D. I in the Samoa area and is dispersed from there to the rest of the Pacific. The plant was transferred either by birds carrying the seed or, more likely, through an accidental casting of a vessel carrying it upon an island of the Samoa region. The word kumara, alleged by many to show direct contact between Polynesians and Quechuan-speaking Indians, apparently reconstructs to Proto-Polynesian and was introduced into the Quechua dictionaries to reflect the educated Spaniard’s knowledge of sweetpotato terms.},

	abstract = {The appearance of people associated with the Lapita culture in the South Pacific around 3,000 years ago marked the beginning of the last major human dispersal to unpopulated lands. However, the relationship of these pioneers to the long-established Papuan people of the New Guinea region is unclear. Here we present genome-wide ancient DNA data from three individuals from Vanuatu (about 3,100–2,700 years before present) and one from Tonga (about 2,700–2,300 years before present), and analyse them with data from 778 present-day East Asians and Oceanians. Today, indigenous people of the South Pacific harbour a mixture of ancestry from Papuans and a population of East Asian origin that no longer exists in unmixed form, but is a match to the ancient individuals. Most analyses have interpreted the minimum of twenty-five per cent Papuan ancestry in the region today as evidence that the first humans to reach Remote Oceania, including Polynesia, were derived from population mixtures near New Guinea, before their further expansion into Remote Oceania. However, our finding that the ancient individuals had little to no Papuan ancestry implies that later human population movements spread Papuan ancestry through the South Pacific after the first peopling of the islands.},

The CSG allows users to deploy jobs on the highperformance computers of the TeraGrid without requiring detailed knowledge of their complexities. Use of the CSG has grown rapidly; through March 2011 it had more than 2,200 users and enabled more than 180 peer-reviewed publications. The rapid growth in resource consumption was accommodated by deploying codes on Trestles, a new TeraGrid computer. Tools and policies were developed to insure efficient and effective resource use. This paper describes progress in managing the growth of this public cyberinfrastructure resource and reviews the domain science that it has enabled.},

	abstract = {The aim of the article is to propose a way to determine to what extent a hypothesis H is confirmed if it has successfully passed a classical significance test. Bayesians have already raised many serious objections against significance testing, but in doing so they have always had to rely on epistemic probabilities and a further Bayesian analysis, which are rejected by classical statisticians. Therefore, I will suggest a purely frequentist evaluation procedure for significance tests that should also be accepted by a classical statistician. This procedure likewise indicates some additional problems of significance tests. In some situations, such tests offer only a weak incremental support of a hypothesis, although an absolute confirmation is necessary, and they overestimate positive results for small effects, since the confirmation of H is often rather marginal in these cases. In specific cases, for example, in cases of ESP-hypotheses, such as precognition, this phenomenon leads too easily to a significant confirmation and can be regarded as a form of the probabilistic falsification fallacy.},

	abstract = {Chloroplast genomes supply indispensable information that helps improve the phylogenetic resolution and even as organelle-scale barcodes. Next-generation sequencing technologies have helped promote sequencing of complete chloroplast genomes, but compared with the number of angiosperms, relatively few chloroplast genomes have been sequenced. There are two major reasons for the paucity of completely sequenced chloroplast genomes: (i) massive amounts of fresh leaves are needed for chloroplast sequencing and (ii) there are considerable gaps in the sequenced chloroplast genomes of many plants because of the difficulty of isolating high-quality chloroplast DNA, preventing complete chloroplast genomes from being assembled. To overcome these obstacles, all known angiosperm chloroplast genomes available to date were analysed, and then we designed nine universal primer pairs corresponding to the highly conserved regions. Using these primers, angiosperm whole chloroplast genomes can be amplified using long-range PCR and sequenced using next-generation sequencing methods. The primers showed high universality, which was tested using 24 species representing major clades of angiosperms. To validate the functionality of the primers, eight species representing major groups of angiosperms, that is, early-diverging angiosperms, magnoliids, monocots, Saxifragales, fabids, malvids and asterids, were sequenced and assembled their complete chloroplast genomes. In our trials, only 100 mg of fresh leaves was used. The results show that the universal primer set provided an easy, effective and feasible approach for sequencing whole chloroplast genomes in angiosperms. The designed universal primer pairs provide a possibility to accelerate genome-scale data acquisition and will therefore magnify the phylogenetic resolution and species identification in angiosperms.},

	abstract = {Skin color is one of the most conspicuous ways in which humans vary and has been widely used to define human races. Here we present new evidence indicating that variations in skin color are adaptive, and are related to the regulation of ultraviolet (UV) radiation penetration in the integument and its direct and indirect effects on fitness. Using remotely sensed data on UV radiation levels, hypotheses concerning the distribution of the skin colors of indigenous peoples relative to UV levels were tested quantitatively in this study for the first time. The major results of this study are: (1) skin reflectance is strongly correlated with absolute latitude and UV radiation levels. The highest correlation between skin reflectance and UV levels was observed at 545 nm, near the absorption maximum for oxyhemoglobin, suggesting that the main role of melanin pigmentation in humans is regulation of the effects of UV radiation on the contents of cutaneous blood vessels located in the dermis. (2) Predicted skin reflectances deviated little from observed values. (3) In all populations for which skin reflectance data were available for males and females, females were found to be lighter skinned than males. (4) The clinal gradation of skin coloration observed among indigenous peoples is correlated with UV radiation levels and represents a compromise solution to the conflicting physiological requirements of photoprotection and vitamin D synthesis. The earliest members of the hominid lineage probably had a mostly unpigmented or lightly pigmented integument covered with dark black hair, similar to that of the modern chimpanzee. The evolution of a naked, darkly pigmented integument occurred early in the evolution of the genus Homo. A dark epidermis protected sweat glands from UV-induced injury, thus insuring the integrity of somatic thermoregulation. Of greater significance to individual reproductive success was that highly melanized skin protected against UV-induced photolysis of folate (Branda \& Eaton, 1978, Science201, 625–626; Jablonski, 1992, Proc. Australas. Soc. Hum. Biol.5, 455–462, 1999, Med. Hypotheses52, 581–582), a metabolite essential for normal development of the embryonic neural tube (Bower \& Stanley, 1989, The Medical Journal of Australia150, 613–619; Medical Research Council Vitamin Research Group, 1991, The Lancet338, 31–37) and spermatogenesis (Cosentino et al., 1990, Proc. Natn. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.87, 1431–1435; Mathur et al., 1977, Fertility Sterility28, 1356–1360). As hominids migrated outside of the tropics, varying degrees of depigmentation evolved in order to permit UVB-induced synthesis of previtamin D3. The lighter color of female skin may be required to permit synthesis of the relatively higher amounts of vitamin D3necessary during pregnancy and lactation. Skin coloration in humans is adaptive and labile. Skin pigmentation levels have changed more than once in human evolution. Because of this, skin coloration is of no value in determining phylogenetic relationships among modern human groups.},

	abstract = {The genetic mechanisms regulating dry fruit development and opercular dehiscence have been identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the bicarpellate silique, valve elongation and differentiation is controlled by FRUITFULL (FUL) that antagonizes SHATTERPROOF1-2 (SHP1/SHP2) and INDEHISCENT (IND) at the dehiscence zone where they control normal lignification. SHP1/2 are also repressed by REPLUMLESS (RPL), responsible for replum formation. Similarly, FUL indirectly controls two other factors ALCATRAZ (ALC) and SPATULA (SPT) that function in the proper formation of the separation layer. FUL and SHP1/2 belong to the MADS-box family, IND and ALC belong to the bHLH family and RPL belongs to the homeodomain family, all of which are large transcription factor families. These families have undergone numerous duplications and losses in plants, likely accompanied by functional changes. Functional analyses of homologous genes suggest that this network is fairly conserved in Brassicaceae and less conserved in other core eudicots. Only the MADS box genes have been functionally characterized in basal eudicots and suggest partial conservation of the functions recorded for Brassicaceae. Here we do a comprehensive search of SHP, IND, ALC, SPT, and RPL homologs across core-eudicots, basal eudicots, monocots and basal angiosperms. Based on gene-tree analyses we hypothesize what parts of the network for fruit development in Brassicaceae, in particular regarding direct and indirect targets of FUL, might be conserved across angiosperms.},

This capacity for mutualism is phylogenetically broad, extending to other Chlamydomonas and fungal species. Furthermore, we witnessed the spontaneous association of Chlamydomonas algal cells physically interacting with filamentous fungi. These observations demonstrate that under specific conditions, environmental change induces free-living species to become obligate mutualists and establishes a set of experimentally tractable, phylogenetically related, synthetic systems for studying the evolution of symbiosis.},

Con el paso de los siglos, tras el Renacimiento, con la aparición de los gabinetes de curiosidades y el afianzamiento de las instituciones que albergaban estos objetos de Historia Natural en el siglo XVIII, dio origen al nacimiento y consolidación de los grandes museos modernos. Se describe brevemente la evolución histórica del concepto social de colección hasta el siglo XVII y su transformación en los siguientes siglos, desde una ciencia meramente descriptiva hasta la actualidad. La sistematización de la nomenclatura, el desarrollo de disciplinas como la Ecología, la Etología, la Biogeografía, la Genética, la Bioquímica etc., han exigido nuevos métodos y técnicas de conservación de los ejemplares de colección y la exhaustividad en la conservación de la información. Conocidas las necesidades de información que el desarrollo de algunas disciplinas científicas más modernas demandan de las colecciones, se proponen una serie de parámetros además de los hasta ahora más comunes, empleados históricamente, que son necesarios recoger en los trabajos de catalogación actuales; así como otros soportes que -en el momento actual o futuro- puedan aportar información, como fotografías, grabaciones de cantos, altitud, flora o fauna asociada, etc. Se estimula, mediante diferentes supuestos teóricos, la necesidad de confeccionar catálogos de colecciones completas o subcolecciones, independientemente de la riqueza o abundancia en especies, ejemplares o distribución geográfica. Por último, se incide en que, como en cualquier otro trabajo científico, estos catálogos deben realizarse con afán de perdurabilidad, ya que en ocasiones podrían subsistir más que los propios ejemplares que en ellos se recogen.},

El rápido aumento en el tránsito de personas y mercancías ligado a la creciente globalización ha multiplicado, sin embargo, la escala espacial de las introducciones, y el número de organismos que se transportan de una región a otra. Muchas de estas especies exóticas tienen la capacidad de alterar seriamente el funcionamiento de los nuevos ecosistemas en los que son introducidas, causando grandes daños no sólo ecológicos sino también económicos: plagas que reducen la producción agrícola, plantas cuyo polen es alergógeno, plantas y animales que dañan infraestructuras o afectan a nuestros alimentos. Además, el cambio climático facilita la expansión de especies exóticas de zonas cálidas, mientras que el aumento de las perturbaciones de origen humano favorece a las especies oportunistas y de rápido crecimiento. En este libro se repasan ideas de biología y ecología que permiten comprender las invasiones biológicas, qué las hace posible y cuáles son sus efectos sobre los ecosistemas receptores. Se incluyen también nociones sobre el control y la gestión de las invasiones, y numerosos casos concretos.

While the post-Columbus dispersal of sweetpotato to Asia and Oceania is well documented, the hypothesis that there was prehistoric transfer by Peruvian or Polynesian voyagers from Peru to Oceania has long been a controversial issue. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and interrelationship of sweetpotato cultivars from Oceania and Latin America and to test the hypothesis of human transfer of this crop to the Pacific Islands in prehistoric time. Seventy-six sweetpotato cultivars from Peru-Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines and eight Oceania countries were analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed wide genetic variation in the Oceania gene pool, greater than that of Peru-Ecuador. There was a significant sweetpotato “gene flow” from Mexico to Oceania. In contrast, there is little association between the Peru-Ecuador germplasm and that of Oceania. These results suggest that Peru-Ecuador may not be the source of the Oceania germplasm. Natural dispersal from Mesoamerica is an alternative explanation to the ‘Kumara hypothesis’ for the origin of the Oceania sweetpotato.},

Lam.) in many agricultural systems throughout the Pacific, there is no direct evidence for this root crop in the fossil pollen record. This has frustrated attempts to construct detailed chronologies of first appearance and rates of dispersal of sweet potato across the region. Field observations and results from experiments on pollen preservation in garden soils and its resilience to palynological procedures have found that sweet potato pollen is unlikely to be recovered from sedimentary environments. This appears to be due to its strictly entomophilous (insect dispersed) pollination habit and the high susceptibility of the pollen exine to physical and chemical degradation. In the absence of direct evidence for sweet potato in the pollen records, palaeoecological studies in the highlands of New Guinea have used sediment and pollen indicators of increased landscape clearance and degradation to infer its presence in the region as early as 800 AD. We explore the nature and veracity of this evidence and suggest that alternative approaches to landscape history are required to adequately explain the sediment and pollen records.},

En realidad, hoy día, desde la lingüística en el análisis computacional de textos, a la simple representación gráfica de la información, pasando por los estudios epidemiológicos, la biotectnología, la genética, la ecología, las ciencias de la educación, psicometría, econometría, finanzas, ciencias sociales, medicina, matemáticas, bellas artes, etc., requieren antes o después de un análisis de datos. R no es sólo un programa, es una forma de trabajar y manera de pensar; además admite sabores y versiones personales, pero sobre todo es un lenguaje, más concretamente es la lingua franca actual del análisis de datos.},

In all cases, we identify substantial progress and novel insights provided by the tools and perspective of EvoDevo. We also recognize that some core questions remain unanswered, and we reflect on how discoveries in EvoDevo fit in the landscape of other progress in phylogenetics, population biology, and genomics, facilitated by a new and ever-expanding set of molecular tools for comparative studies in evolution.},

	abstract = {The history of sweet potato in the Pacific has long been an enigma. Archaeological, linguistic, and ethnobotanical data suggest that prehistoric human-mediated dispersal events contributed to the distribution in Oceania of this American domesticate. According to the “tripartite hypothesis,” sweet potato was introduced into Oceania from South America in pre-Columbian times and was then later newly introduced, and diffused widely across the Pacific, by Europeans via two historically documented routes from Mexico and the Caribbean. Although sweet potato is the most convincing example of putative pre-Columbian connections between human occupants of Polynesia and South America, the search for genetic evidence of pre-Columbian dispersal of sweet potato into Oceania has been inconclusive. Our study attempts to fill this gap. Using complementary sets of markers (chloroplast and nuclear microsatellites) and both modern and herbarium samples, we test the tripartite hypothesis. Our results provide strong support for prehistoric transfer(s) of sweet potato from South America (Peru-Ecuador region) into Polynesia. Our results also document a temporal shift in the pattern of distribution of genetic variation in sweet potato in Oceania. Later reintroductions, accompanied by recombination between distinct sweet potato gene pools, have reshuffled the crop’s initial genetic base, obscuring primary patterns of diffusion and, at the same time, giving rise to an impressive number of local variants. Moreover, our study shows that phenotypes, names, and neutral genes do not necessarily share completely parallel evolutionary histories. Multidisciplinary approaches, thus, appear necessary for accurate reconstruction of the intertwined histories of plants and humans.},

	abstract = {The preparation of a cup of coffee may vary between countries, cultures and individuals. Here, an analysis of nine different extraction methods is presented regarding analytical and sensory aspects for four espressi and five lunghi. This comprised espresso and lungo from a semi-automatic coffee machine, espresso and lungo from a fully automatic coffee machine, espresso from a singleserve capsule system, mocha made with a percolator, lungo prepared with French Press extraction, filter coffee and lungo extracted with a Bayreuth coffee machine. Analytical measurements included headspace analysis with HS SPME GC/MS, acidity (pH), titratable acidity, content of fatty acids, total solids, refractive indices (expressed in ⬚Brix), caffeine and chlorogenic acids content with HPLC. Sensory analysis included visual, aroma, flavor and textural attributes as well as aftersensation. The technical differences in the extraction methods led to a higher concentration of the respective quantities in the espressi than in the lunghi. Regarding the contents per cup of coffee, the lunghi generally had a higher content than the espressi. The extraction efficiency of the respective compounds was mainly driven by their solubility in water. A higher amount of water, as in the extraction of a lungo, generally led to higher extraction efficiency. Comparing analytical data with sensory profiles, the following positive correlations were found total solids {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textgreater texture/body, headspace intensity {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textgreateraroma intensity, concentrations of caffeine/chlorogenic acids {\textbackslash}textless{\textbackslash}textgreater bitterness and astringency.},

	abstract = {Background Co-flowering plant species frequently share pollinators. Pollinator sharing is often detrimental to one or more of these species, leading to competition for pollination. Perhaps because it offers an intriguing juxtaposition of ecological opposites – mutualism and competition – within one relatively tractable system, competition for pollination has captured the interest of ecologists for over a century. Scope Our intent is to contemplate exciting areas for further work on competition for pollination, rather than to exhaustively review past studies. After a brief historical summary, we present a conceptual framework that incorporates many aspects of competition for pollination, involving both the quantity and quality of pollination services, and both female and male sex functions of flowers. Using this framework, we contemplate a relatively subtle mechanism of competition involving pollen loss, and consider how competition might affect plant mating systems, overall reproductive success and multi-species interactions. We next consider how competition for pollination might be altered by several emerging consequences of a changing planet, including the spread of alien species, climate change and pollinator declines. Most of these topics represent new frontiers whose exploration has just begun. Conclusions Competition for pollination has served as a model for the integration of ecological and evolutionary perspectives in the study of species interactions. Its study has elucidated both obvious and more subtle mechanisms, and has documented a range of outcomes. However, the potential for this interaction to inform our understanding of both pure and applied aspects of pollination biology has only begun to be realized.},

This annual twining vine is heterophyllous and its leaves possess well-defined palisade and spongy mesophyll layers. Paracytic stomata and multicellular, glandular and unicellular, eglandular trichomes occur on both the leaves and stems The midrib and major veins are composed of bicollateral bundles, while minor veins are composed of collateral bundles The petiole base consists of two adaxial and three abaxial bicollateral bundles. Development of the stem vasculature of this twining vine may be separated into five ontogenetic stages: the bicollateral bundle stage, the cambium-like meristem stage, the normal cambial stage, the anomalous cambial stage and the supernumerary cambial stage The primary vasculature of the stem consists of bicollateral bundles. Later the external protophloem is separated from the protoxylem and internal phloem by a cambium-like meristem that produces cylinders of external metaphloem and metaxylem. A cambium then arises between the external phloem and the primary xylem and produces secondary phloem centrifugally and secondary xylem centripetally Lobed, concentric and foraminate patterns of anomalous secondary growth finally occur in the stem The lobed pattern consists of two bands of secondary phloem and two lobes of secondary xylem The concentric pattern arises from the activity of both a discontinuous supernumerary cambium that develops within the secondary phloem and an internal cambium that originates from parenchyma cells between the primary xylem and internal phloem. A foraminate pattern then develops as included phloem forms within parenchymatous islands of the secondary xylem Ipomoea hederifolia has a taproot that also possesses a foraminate pattern of anomalous secondary growth The outer boundary of this organ is a periderm of subepidermal origin Although the cellular composition of the secondary vascular tissues in the taproot is similar to that of the stem, the secondary xylem is less parenchymatous in the root},

Although the distributional effects of population growth are likely to be uneven (as ‘across the globe, the planet is both full and empty’), it is argued that it is not so much the number of people on the planet that matters most, but how they choose to live and interact with their surroundings. In an increasingly complex and interconnected world, the prudent management of available resources, fragile systems, and emerging challenges can make all the difference. Historical attempts to chart the links between population growth and development—from Malthus to the ‘Earth Summit’—are considered. It is suggested that more cross-disciplinary work is required to move these debates forward. The discussion concludes by summarizing the following ten chapters that attempt to answer the question ‘is the planet full?’ from a range of disciplinary perspectives.},

The structure of petiolar nectaries in the genus ranges from simple beds of superficial nectar-secreting trichomes (1 species), to slightly recessed "basin nectaries" (8 species), to "crypt nectaries," which are structurally the most complex extrafloral nectaries known (3 species). (Structures were not determined for 3 species.) Petiolar nectaries are present in all subgenera, but all crypt nectaries occur in the same section (Eriospermum). Species with extrafloral nectaries tend to be perennial; species lacking extrafloral nectaries tend to be annual.

	abstract = {There is often an inverse relationship between the diversity of a plant community and the invasibility of that community by non-native plants. Native herbivores that colonize novel plants may contribute to diversity–invasibility relationships by limiting the relative success of non-native plants. Here, we show that, in large collections of non-native oak trees at sites across the USA, non-native oaks introduced to regions with greater oak species richness accumulated greater leaf damage than in regions with low oak richness. Underlying this trend was the ability of herbivores to exploit non-native plants that were close relatives to their native host. In diverse oak communities, non-native trees were on average more closely related to native trees and received greater leaf damage than those in depauperate oak communities. Because insect herbivores colonize non-native plants that are similar to their native hosts, in communities with greater native plant diversity, non-natives experience greater herbivory.},

	abstract = {Lead (Pb) is one of the most toxic metals in the environment and may cause drastic morphological and physiological deformities in Ipomoea lacunosa. The goal of this research was to evaluate some morphological and physiological responses of morning glory grown on a Pb- and chelate-amended soil. Soil samples were analyzed, at Mississippi State University Soil Laboratory, for physico-chemical parameters, such as soil texture (73\% sand, 23\% silt, 4.4\% clay), organic matter (6.24 ± 0.60\%), and pH (7.95 ± 0.03), to establish soil conditions at the beginning of the experiments. Five EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid) concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 5mM) and four lead (0, 500, 1000, 2000mg/L) treatments were arranged in factorial in a Randomized Complete Block (RCB) design with five replications. Duncan’s multiple comparison range test showed that the mean difference values of stomatal density were significant between 500 and 1000mg/L Pb and between 1000 and 2000mg/L Pb. Two way ANOVA (at 1\% level) indicated that interaction between Pb and EDTA had a significant effect on the stomatal density and photosynthetic rates, and at 5\% level Pb had a significant effect on chlorophyll concentrations. Lowest concentrations of chlorophyll were recorded at 2000mg/L Pb and 5mM EDTA and exhibited a decreasing trend specifically in the ranges of 1000 and 2000mg/L Pb and 1.0 and 5.0mM EDTA. Duncan’s multiple comparison range test confirmed that mean differences between the control treatment vs. 2000mg/L Pb, and 500mg/L vs. 2000mg/L Pb were significantly different at p{\textbackslash}textgreater0.05. There was a decrease in leaf net photosynthetic rate with increasing concentrations of Pb from 0 to 2000mg/L. In conclusion, I. lacunosa L. plants were grown to maturity in all treatments with no significant and/or apparent morphological disorders, which indicated that this species might be highly tolerant even at 2000mg/L Pb concentrations in the soil.},

Genetic evidence suggests that the acquisition of a highly stable melanocortin 1 receptor allele promoting black pigmentation arose around the time of savannah colonization by hominins at some 1–2 Ma. The adaptive significance of dark skin is generally believed to be protection from UV damage but the pathologies that might have had a deleterious impact on survival and/or reproductive fitness, though much debated, are uncertain. Here, I suggest that data on age-associated cancer incidence and lethality in albinos living at low latitudes in both Africa and Central America support the contention that skin cancer could have provided a potent selective force for the emergence of black skin in early hominins.},

Nodal explant cultures were initiated in MS (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) medium supplemented with 3\% sucrose and 0.5mg/l Benzyl Amino Purine (BAP) and solidified by either 12\% sweet potato, 12\% Irish potato, 15\% cassava starch or 0.8\% agar (w/v). Shoots were multiplied through 3 subcultures in BAP free MS medium with 5mg/l gibberelic acid. The overall quality of shoots in starch based media was slightly lower than in agar medium. In 84 days, average number of propagules produced from one explant was 40 in Irish potato medium, 1312 in cassava, 2058 in sweet potato and 3584 in agar. Despite the low multiplication rate of shoots produced on starch media, the cost per propagules was reduced by about 67\%, 44\% and 33\% for sweet potato, cassava and Irish potato starches, respectively. This result suggests that, although starch based media were not as efficient as agar, , sweet potato and cassava starch may be suitable agar substitutes due to low costs and good quality of propagules.},

It is generally assumed that this loss reflects the fact that most organisms do not tolerate well the environmental alterations associated with urbanisation. Nevertheless, current evidence is inconclusive and the alternative that the biodiversity loss is the result of random mechanisms has never been evaluated. Analysing changes in abundance between urbanised environments and their non-urbanised surroundings of {\textbackslash}textgreater 800 avian species from five continents, we show here that although random processes account for part of the species loss associated with urbanisation, much of the loss is associated with a lack of appropriate adaptations of most species for exploiting resources and avoiding risks of the urban environments. These findings have important conservation implications because the extinction of species with particular features should have higher impact on biodiversity and ecosystem function than a random loss.},

	abstract = {• Premise of the study: The dramatic advances offered by modern DNA sequencers continue to redefi ne the limits of what can be accomplished in comparative plant biology. Even with recent achievements, however, plant genomes present obstacles that can make it difficult to execute large-scale population and phylogenetic studies on next-generation sequencing platforms. Factors like large genome size, extensive variation in the proportion of organellar DNA in total DNA, polyploidy, and gene number/redundancy contribute to these challenges, and they demand flexible targeted enrichment strategies to achieve the desired goals. • Methods: In this article, we summarize the many available targeted enrichment strategies that can be used to target partial-tocomplete organellar genomes, as well as known and anonymous nuclear targets. These methods fall under four categories: PCR-based enrichment, hybridization-based enrichment, restriction enzyme-based enrichment, and enrichment of expressed gene sequences. • Key results: Examples of plant-specific applications exist for nearly all methods described. While some methods are well established (e.g., transcriptome sequencing), other promising methods are in their infancy (hybridization enrichment). A direct comparison of methods shows that PCR-based enrichment may be a reasonable strategy for accessing small genomic targets (e.g., ≤ 50 kbp), but that hybridization and transcriptome sequencing scale more efficiently if larger targets are desired. • Conclusions: While the benefits of targeted sequencing are greatest in plants with large genomes, nearly all comparative projects can benefit from the improved throughput offered by targeted multiplex DNA sequencing, particularly as the amount of data produced from a single instrument approaches a trillion bases per run.},

It is, however, not yet clear whether these skills are accompanied by an understanding of the self. In apes, self-directed behavior in response to a mirror has been taken as evidence of self-recognition. We investigated mirror-induced behavior in the magpie, a songbird species from the crow family. As in apes, some individuals behaved in front of the mirror as if they were testing behavioral contingencies. When provided with a mark, magpies showed spontaneous mark-directed behavior. Our findings provide the first evidence of mirror self-recognition in a non-mammalian species. They suggest that essential components of human selfrecognition have evolved independently in different vertebrate classes with a separate evolutionary history.},

	abstract = {Plant evolution is largely driven by adaptations in seed protection and dispersal strategies that allow diversification into new niches. This is evident by the tremendous variation in flowering and fruiting structures present both across and within different plant lineages. Within a single plant family a staggering variety of fruit types can be found such as fleshy fruits including berries, pomes, and drupes and dry fruit structures like achenes, capsules, and follicles. What are the evolutionary mechanisms that enable such dramatic shifts to occur in a relatively short period of time? This remains a fundamental question of plant biology today. On the surface it seems that these extreme differences in form and function must be the consequence of very different developmental programs that require unique sets of genes. Yet as we begin to decipher the molecular and genetic basis underlying fruit form it is becoming apparent that simple genetic changes in key developmental regulatory genes can have profound anatomical effects. In this review, we discuss recent advances in understanding the molecular mechanisms of fruit endocarp tissue differentiation that have contributed to species diversification within three plant lineages.},

Many of the genomic and expression alterations have occurred on an evolutionary timescale, whereas others reflect more immediate consequences of genomic merger.},

	shorttitle = {Why {Did} the {Chicken} {Cross} the {World}?},
	abstract = {From ancient empires to modern economics, veteran journalist Andrew Lawler delivers a sweeping history of the animal that has been most crucial to the spread of civilization across the globe—the chicken.Queen Victoria was obsessed with it. Socrates’ last words were about it. Charles Darwin and Louis Pasteur made their scientific breakthroughs using it. Catholic popes, African shamans, Chinese philosophers, and Muslim mystics praised it. Throughout the history of civilization, humans have embraced it in every form imaginable—as a messenger of the gods, powerful sex symbol, gambling aid, emblem of resurrection, all-purpose medicine, handy research tool, inspiration for bravery, epitome of evil, and, of course, as the star of the world’s most famous joke. In Why Did the Chicken Cross the World?, science writer Andrew Lawler takes us on an adventure from prehistory to the modern era with a fascinating account of the partnership between human and chicken (the most successful of all cross-species relationships). Beginning with the recent discovery in Montana that the chicken’s unlikely ancestor is T. rex, this book builds on Lawler’s popular Smithsonian cover article, “How the Chicken Conquered the World” to track the chicken from its original domestication in the jungles of Southeast Asia some 10,000 years ago to postwar America, where it became the most engineered of animals, to the uncertain future of what is now humanity’s single most important source of protein. In a masterful combination of historical sleuthing and journalistic exploration on four continents, Lawler reframes the way we feel and think about our most important animal partner—and, by extension, all domesticated animals, and even nature itself. Lawler’s narrative reveals the secrets behind the chicken’s transformation from a shy jungle bird into an animal of astonishing versatility, capable of serving our species’ changing needs. For no other siren has called humans to rise, shine, and prosper quite like the rooster’s cry: “cock-a-doodle-doo!”},

Big decisions are being taken now about Europe's energy future as the EU negotiates a new set of climate and energy targets for 2030. This briefing shows that the only way to guarantee secure and affordable energy, and to climate-proof Europe’s food, is for the EU to urgently increase climate action and to wean itself off fossil fuels, rather than opt for a dead-end route of more coal extraction and fracking. Oxfam is calling for the EU to agree targets to reduce energy demand and boost sustainable renewable energy to help cut emissions by at least 55 percent by 2030. These actions will help to keep energy affordable for Europe and tackle climate change – which will have most impact on the poorest people and reverse the fight against hunger. - See more at: http://www.oxfam.org/en/grow/policy/eu-2030-energy-and-climate-change-package\#sthash.uvFWJwxZ.dpuf},

Photosynthesis plays a big role in removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in wood and soils, so mapping vegetation is a key part of studying the carbon cycle. Farmers and resource managers also use satellite-based vegetation maps to help them monitor the health of our forests and croplands. On these maps, vegetation is pictured as a scale, or index, of greenness. Greenness is based on several factors: the number and type of plants, how leafy they are, and how healthy they are. In places where foliage is dense and plants are growing quickly, the index is high, represented in dark green. Regions where few plants grow have a low vegetation index, shown in tan. The index is based on measurements taken by the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on NASA’s Terra satellite. Areas where the satellite did not collect data are gray. The most obvious pattern that the maps show is a global one: vegetation greenness is high around the equator all year long, where temperatures, rainfall and sunlight are abundant. Between the equator and the poles, the vegetation greenness rises and falls as the seasons change.},

Approximately 90\% of the genotypes of accession 81.2 (I. batatas, 4x) produced 2n pollen with different frequencies. In contrast, none of the genotypes of I. triloba produced 2n pollen. The diameter of the 2n pollen was approximately 30\% ((3) sqrt 2) larger than that of the n pollen, making it easy to identify, measure, and quantify. The correlation (r = 0.93**) between the frequency of giant pollen and the frequency of dyads and triads was highly significant, strongly suggesting that the giant pollen grains were 2n pollen. The 2n pollen producers presented either a parallel or tripolar spindle arrangement (Y shaped) at anaphase II instead of the normal 60 degrees crossed spindle orientation. These two abnormal spindle configurations produced dyads and triads, with different frequencies (13-67\%), instead of tetrads. Occasionally a metaphase II spindle variation was found with a single fused spindle, which also forms a dyad. The correlation (r = 0.89**) between the frequency of 2n pollen and the frequency of parallel, fused, and tripolar spindle arrangements was also highly significant, suggesting that these abnormal spindle configurations are involved in the production of 2n pollen in I. batatas. When we evaluated the efficiency of 2n pollen in polyploidization using 4x x 4x (2n) crosses, all progenies were 4x, suggesting the existence of barriers to crossability between 4x genotypes and their 2n pollen-producer counterparts.},

By combining multiplexing approaches with NGS throughput, systematists may no longer need to choose between more taxa or more characters. Here we describe a genome skimming (shallow sequencing) approach for plant systematics. • Methods: Through simulations, we evaluated optimal sequencing depth and performance of single-end and paired-end short read sequences for assembly of nuclear ribosomal DNA (rDNA) and plastomes and addressed the effect of divergence on reference-guided plastome assembly. We also used simulations to identify potential phylogenetic markers from low-copy nuclear loci at different sequencing depths. We demonstrated the utility of genome skimming through phylogenetic analysis of the Sonoran Desert clade (SDC) of Asclepias (Apocynaceae). • Key results: Paired-end reads performed better than single-end reads. Minimum sequencing depths for high quality rDNA and plastome assemblies were 40× and 30×, respectively. Divergence from the reference significantly affected plastome assembly, but relatively similar references are available for most seed plants. Deeper rDNA sequencing is necessary to characterize intragenomic polymorphism. The low-copy fraction of the nuclear genome was readily surveyed, even at low sequencing depths. Nearly 160000 bp of sequence from three organelles provided evidence of phylogenetic incongruence in the SDC. • Conclusions: Adoption of NGS will facilitate progress in plant systematics, as whole plastome and rDNA cistrons, partial mitochondrial genomes, and low-copy nuclear markers can now be efficiently obtained for molecular phylogenetics studies.},

We describe links between the two methods—for example, we describe how MP can be regarded as an ML method when there is no common mechanism between sites (such as might occur with morphological data and certain forms of molecular data). In the process, we clarify certain historical points of disagreement between proponents of the two methodologies, including a discussion of several forms of the ML optimality criterion. We also describe some additional results that shed light on how much needs to be assumed about underling models of sequence evolution in order to successfully reconstruct evolutionary trees.},

Native informants' statements that the Willie Wagtail, Rhipidura leucophrys, is responsible are reported and assessed. The possibility that migratory birds such as the Golden Plover, Charadrius dominicus, or the Peregrine Falcon, Falco peregrinus, could be responsible for the initial introduction of the sweet-potato, or for the introduction of new varieties, to the New Guinea Highlands and some other regions of the Pacific is discussed: although this seems highly improbable, it cannot be altogether discounted.

The oldest radiocarbon ages of the sampled deposits are 1300–1625 AD and 1310–1470 AD. The pollen and phytolith evidence suggests a change from more to less trees and shrubs in the area as a result of human activity. We found phytoliths of banana (Musa sp.) leaves in most and starch grains and xylem cells of tuberous roots of c.f. sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) in all of the samples, suggesting that the sampled features were associated with these crops and that both crops were cultivated intensively within the study area. Higher concentrations (volumetric) of starch and xylem in samples from older deposits suggest that cultivation was more intensive then. The apparent absence of starch and xylem remains of other tuberous crops archaeologically identified elsewhere in Polynesia suggests that tuberous cropping within the study area was mono-specific.},

In both of these organism classes, imprinting occurs in embryo-nourishing tissues-the placenta and the endosperm, respectively. It has been proposed that some imprinted genes control nutrient flow from the mother to the offspring. Genome-wide analyses of imprinted genes in plants have revealed that many imprinted genes are located in the vicinity of transposon or repeat sequences, implying that transposon insertions are associated with the evolution of imprinted loci. Imprinted expression of a number of genes is conserved between monocots and dicots, suggesting that long-term selection can maintain imprinted expression at some loci. In terms of epigenetic mechanisms, imprinted expression is largely controlled by an antagonistic action of DNA methylation and Polycomb group-mediated histone methylation in the vicinity of imprinted genes, whereby the position of such epigenetic modifications can determine whether a gene will be expressed mainly from either the maternally or paternally inherited alleles. © 2012 by Annual Reviews.

Microfossils become imbedded within dental calculus throughout life, providing an overall picture of plant foods available (at least those that produce recoverable microfossils). Here we evaluate previous phytolith results (Dudgeon and Tromp, 2012) by examining starch grains from 30 human dental calculus samples from 10 archaeological sites throughout Rapa Nui (Easter Island), dating between AD 1330–1900. The unobscured starch grains recovered are consistent with descriptions of modern reference samples of sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). These results indicate the importance of sweet potato to the Rapanui diet prior to European contact in 1722. The analysis of modern sweet potato skins show that they incorporate phytoliths as they grow in phytolith rich sediment, and we argue that the high frequency of palm phytoliths recovered from dental calculus, in conjunction with our starch results points to the consumption of sweet potato.},

Genetic analyses have revealed a Central Asian origin for cultivated apple, together with an unexpectedly large secondary contribution from the European crabapple. Wild apple species display strong population structures and high levels of introgression from domesticated apple, and this may threaten their genetic integrity. Recent research has revealed a major role of hybridization in the domestication of the cultivated apple and has highlighted the value of apple as an ideal model for unraveling adaptive diversification processes in perennial fruit crops.

	abstract = {There is still limited information on growth and potassium (K) accumulation in sweet potato in response to varying K supply levels over time, and the quantification of such characteristics is necessary to screen for high K absorption and utilization-efficient genotypes. In field experiments in 2012, 108 sweet potato genotypes or breeding lines were screened without K or with a 300 kg ha−1 K2SO4 supply. Seven elite genotypes, Xu22, Nan88, Wan5, Wan6, Xu085, Xu083 and Ji22, selected from the 2012 experiments were tested with different K application levels (0, 150, 300, and 450 kg ha−1 K2SO4) in 2013. Significant intraspecific variations among genotypes and responses to K supplies existed in the root dry matter yield and biomass yield, and in K concentrations, accumulations and use efficiencies (KIUEs) of the sweet potatoes in the initial field experiment. In the advanced field experiment, a K fertilizer application increased tuberous root dry matter of sweet potato by increasing the tuber number, and, to a lesser degree, the mean tuber weight. K accumulation levels in the seven elite sweet potato genotypes peaked under a deficient K supply at 100 days after plantation and decreased, to different extents, at maturity. Based on K accumulation at different growth stages under a K deficiency and K accumulation at maturity with different K supply levels, Nan88 and Xu082 were rated as K uptake efficient, and Ji22 and Xu083 as K uptake inefficient. According to the KIUE for tuberous root yield (KIUE-T) under deficient K and adequate K supplies, the genotypes were classified as being efficient or inefficient in K utilization. Genotypes Xu28 and Wan5 were K-efficient and Ji22 was K-inefficient in both experiments. KIUE-T had a significant positive correlation with the relative root weight per plant, with the tuberous root dry matter increasing from expanding stage to maturity, and it had a significant negative correlation with K concentrations in the roots or whole plants at maturity. No significant correlation was found between root dry matter yield and KIUE.},

	abstract = {K123 (Ipomoea trifida (H.B.K.) G. Don.) which was collected in Mexico, is a wild species closely related to the cultivated sweet potato, I. batatas (L.) LAMK. (.NISHIYAMA 1959, NISHIYAMA, FUJISE, TERAMURA, and MIYAZAKI 1961). In th:e present work, the physiological and ecolo-gical characters of K123 were studied in comparis-on with those of I. batatas. There was observed a considerable variation in the development of stems, leaves and roots, in different clones (or 20 seedlings from the original K123) as well as under different growth conditions. Generally all clones of K123 were very similar to I. batatas, but were clearly different in some characters (Figs. 1 and 2). The flowering begins in July in a few clones, but in September in most clanes of K 123, though the number of flowers are usually limited in the natural condition. Artificial treatments such as grafting and double treatments (grafting and short-day) were g:enerally effective in promoting the date of flowering and in increasing the number of flowers, although the effect of each treatement was different by clones (Figs. 3 and 4). In order to obtain a measure of self- or crossincompatibility of the clones, germinationl of pollen grains artificially dusted on the stigma was observed. Out of 20 clones of K123, 17 were self-incom-patible, 2 incompletely self-compatible, and 1 self-cornpatible. Based on the results of crossincompatibility tests among these 20 clones, about 7 cross-incompatibility groups were identified. All the clones of K 123 were cross-compatible with 4 different cross-incompatibility groups of I. batatas, except for 2 clones which were either reciprocally or non-reciprocally incompatible with certain incompatibility groups of I. batatas (Table 1). In a preliminary observations some clones of K123 were found to be resistant to ceatain nematodes (Protylelchus pratensis and Heterodera mariolei) and also to black rot (Ceratostomella fimbriata).},

	abstract = {Abstract Because recent molecular studies, based on multiple data sets from all three plant genomes, have indicated mutually congruent, well-resolved, and well-supported relationships within Convolvulaceae (the morning-glory family), a formal reclassification of this family is presented here. Convolvulaceae, a large family of worldwide distribution, exhibiting a rich diversity of morphological characteristics and ecological habitats, are now circumscribed within twelve tribes. A key to these tribes of Convolvulaceae is offered. The group of spiny-pollen bearing Convolvulaceae (forming “Echinoconiae”) and tribe Cuscuteae are retained essentially in their traditional sense, Cresseae are circumscribed with only minor modifications, Convolvuleae and Erycibeae are recognized in a restricted sense, while Dichondreae and Maripeae are expanded. Also, to produce a tribal taxonomy that better reflects phylogenetic relationships, the concept of Poraneae is abandoned as artificial, three new tribes are recognized (Aniseieae, Cardiochlamyeae, and Jacquemontieae), and a new tribal status is proposed for the Malagasy endemic Humbertia (Humbertieae). “Merremieae” are tentatively retained even though the monophyly of this tribe is not certain. In addition to the formal classification, we provide clade name definitions for the family as well as for most of the clades recognized presently as tribes. Also, five well-supported clades that are not assigned formal ranks are recognized and their names defined. The reevaluation of traditional taxonomic characters reveals that many homoplasious characters were emphasized in previous classifications, resulting in formal recognition of non-monophyletic groups. Putative morphological synapomorphies for many clades discovered through molecular cladistic analyses are discussed. However, the morphology of several clades that are well-supported by DNA evidence remains poorly understood, creating further challenges for future studies in Convolvulaceae.},

Bounty in 1789, yet its origins remain unclear. Breadfruit's closest relatives are A. camansi and A. mariannensis. DNA fingerprinting data (AFLP, amplified fragment length polymorphisms) from over 200 breadfruit cultivars, 30 A. camansi, and 24 A. mariannensis individuals were used to investigate the relationships among these species. Multivariate analyses and the identification of species-specific AFLP markers indicate at least two origins of breadfruit. Most Melanesian and Polynesian cultivars appear to have arisen over generations of vegetative propagation and selection from A. camansi. In contrast, most Micronesian breadfruit cultivars appear to be the result of hybridization between A. camansi-derived breadfruit and A. mariannensis. Because breadfruit depends on humans for dispersal, the data were compared to theories on the human colonization of Oceania. The results agree with the well-supported theory that humans settled Polynesia via Melanesia. Additionally, a long-distance migration from eastern Melanesia into Micronesia is supported.},

Simply dilute the reagent using the buffer provided, add your sample (any volume from 1–20 μL is acceptable), then read the concentration using the Qubit® Fluorometer. The assay is highly selective for double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) over RNA (Figure 1, page 7) and is accurate for initial sample concentrations from 10 pg/µL to 100 ng/µL. The assay is performed at room temperature, and the signal is stable for 3 hours. Common contaminants such as salts, free nucleotides, solvents, detergents, or protein are well tolerated in the assay (Table 2, page 8). In addition to the Qubit® dsDNA HS Assay Kits described here, we also offer other kits for assaying RNA, protein, and dsDNA at a higher concentration range (Table 3, page 9).},

	abstract = {Plant taxonomy is an ancient discipline facing new challenges with the current availability of a vast array of molecular approaches which allow reliable genealogy-based classifications. Although the primary focus of plant taxonomy is on the delimitation of species, molecular approaches also provide a better understanding of evolutionary processes, a particularly important issue for some taxonomic complex groups. 'Molecular Plant Taxonomy: Methods and Protocols" describes laboratory protocols based on the use of nucleic acids and chromosomes for plant taxonomy, as well as guidelines for phylogenetic analysis of molecular data. Experts in the field also contribute review and application chapters that will encourage the reader to develop an integrative taxonomy approach, combining nucleic acid and cytogenetic data together with other crucial information (taxonomy, morphology, anatomy, ecology, reproductive biology, biogeography, paleobotany), which will help not only to best circumvent species delimitation but also to resolve the evolutionary processes in play. Written in the successful "Methods in Molecular Biology" series format, chapters include introductions to their respective topics, lists of the necessary materials and reagents, step-by-step, readily reproducible protocols, and notes on troubleshooting and avoiding known pitfalls. Authoritative and easily accessible, Molecular Plant Taxonomy: Methods and Protocols seeks toprovide conceptual as well as technical guidelines to plant taxonomists and geneticists.–},

	abstract = {The overall objective of this chapter is to review the past, present, and future role of the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas [L.] Lam) in human nutrition. Specifically, the chapter describes the role of the sweet potato in human diets; outlines the biochemical and nutritional composition of the sweet potato with emphasis on its β‐carotene and anthocyanin contents; highlights sweet potato utilization, and its potential as value‐added products in human food systems; and demonstrates the potential of the sweet potato in the African context. Early records have indicated that the sweet potato is a staple food source for many indigenous populations in Central and South Americas, Ryukyu Island, Africa, the Caribbean, the Maori people, Hawaiians, and Papua New Guineans. Protein contents of sweet potato leaves and roots range from 4.0\% to 27.0\% and 1.0\% to 9.0\%, respectively. The sweet potato could be considered as an excellent novel source of natural health‐promoting compounds, such as β‐carotene and anthocyanins, for the functional food market. Also, the high concentration of anthocyanin and β‐carotene in sweet potato, combined with the high stability of the color extract make it a promising and healthier alternative to synthetic coloring agents in food systems. Starch and flour processing from sweet potato can create new economic and employment activities for farmers and rural households, and can add nutritional value to food systems. Repositioning sweet potato production and its potential for value‐added products will contribute substantially to utilizing its benefits and many uses in human food systems. Multidisciplinary, integrated research and development activities aimed at improving production, storage, postharvest and processing technologies, and quality of the sweet potato and its potential value‐added products are critical issues, which should be addressed globally.},

Comparative animal studies represent one approach to understand the origins of these combinatorial layers. Traditionally, phonology, where meaningless sounds form words, has been considered a simpler combination than syntax, and thus should be more common in animals. A linguistically informed review of animal call sequences demonstrates that phonology in animal vocal systems is rare, whereas syntaxis more widespread. In the light of this and the absence of phonology in some languages, we hypothesize that syntax, present in all languages, evolved before phonology.},

	abstract = {Background PCR amplification of minute quantities of degraded DNA for ancient DNA research, forensic analyses, wildlife studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics is often hampered by contamination problems. The extent of these problems is inversely related to DNA concentration and target fragment size and concern (i) sample contamination, (ii) laboratory surface contamination, (iii) carry-over contamination, and (iv) contamination of reagents. Methodology/Principal Findings Here we performed a quantitative evaluation of current decontamination methods for these last three sources of contamination, and developed a new procedure to eliminate contaminating DNA contained in PCR reagents. We observed that most current decontamination methods are either not efficient enough to degrade short contaminating DNA molecules, rendered inefficient by the reagents themselves, or interfere with the PCR when used at doses high enough to eliminate these molecules. We also show that efficient reagent decontamination can be achieved by using a combination of treatments adapted to different reagent categories. Our procedure involves γ- and UV-irradiation and treatment with a mutant recombinant heat-labile double-strand specific DNase from the Antarctic shrimp Pandalus borealis. Optimal performance of these treatments is achieved in narrow experimental conditions that have been precisely analyzed and defined herein. Conclusions/Significance There is not a single decontamination method valid for all possible contamination sources occurring in PCR reagents and in the molecular biology laboratory and most common decontamination methods are not efficient enough to decontaminate short DNA fragments of low concentration. We developed a versatile multistrategy decontamination procedure for PCR reagents. We demonstrate that this procedure allows efficient reagent decontamination while preserving the efficiency of PCR amplification of minute quantities of DNA.},

In this study, a mutant of purple sweet potato (white peel and flesh) was used to study anthocyanin metabolism by high-throughput RNA sequencing and comparative analysis of the mutant and wild type transcriptomes. A total of 88,509 unigenes ranging from 200 nt to 14,986 nt with an average length of 849 nt were obtained. Unigenes were assigned to Gene Ontology (GO), Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG). Functional enrichment using GO and KEGG annotations showed that 3828 of the differently expressed genes probably influenced many important biological and metabolic pathways, including anthocyanin biosynthesis. Most importantly, the structural and transcription factor genes that contribute to anthocyanin biosynthesis were downregulated in the mutant. The unigene dataset that was used to discover the anthocyanin candidate genes can serve as a comprehensive resource for molecular research in sweet potato.},

	abstract = {Chloroplast DNA sequence data are a versatile tool for plant identification or barcoding and establishing genetic relationships among plant species. Different chloroplast loci have been utilized for use at close and distant evolutionary distances in plants, and no single locus has been identified that can distinguish between all plant species. Advances in DNA sequencing technology are providing new cost-effective options for genome comparisons on a much larger scale. Universal PCR amplification of chloroplast sequences or isolation of pure chloroplast fractions, however, are non-trivial. We now propose the analysis of chloroplast genome sequences from massively parallel sequencing (MPS) of total DNA as a simple and cost-effective option for plant barcoding, and analysis of plant relationships to guide gene discovery for biotechnology. We present chloroplast genome sequences of five grass species derived from MPS of total DNA. These data accurately established the phylogenetic relationships between the species, correcting an apparent error in the published rice sequence. The chloroplast genome may be the elusive single-locus DNA barcode for plants.},

	abstract = {There exists extraordinary morphological and genetic diversity among the maize landraces that have been developed by pre-Columbian cultivators. To explain this high level of diversity in maize, several authors have proposed that maize landraces were the products of multiple independent domestications from their wild relative (teosinte). We present phylogenetic analyses based on 264 individual plants, each genotyped at 99 microsatellites, that challenge the multiple-origins hypothesis. Instead, our results indicate that all maize arose from a single domestication in southern Mexico about 9,000 years ago. Our analyses also indicate that the oldest surviving maize types are those of the Mexican highlands with maize spreading from this region over the Americas along two major paths. Our phylogenetic work is consistent with a model based on the archaeological record suggesting that maize diversified in the highlands of Mexico before spreading to the lowlands. We also found only modest evidence for postdomestication gene flow from teosinte into maize.},

	abstract = {Polyploidy has been ubiquitous in plant evolution and is thought to be an important engine of biodiversity that facilitates speciation, adaptation, and range expansion. Polyploid species can exhibit higher ecological tolerance than their progenitor species. For allotetraploid species, this higher tolerance is often attributed to the existence of heterosis resulting from entire genome duplication. However, multiple origins of allopolyploid species may further promote their ecological success by providing genetic variability in ecological traits underlying local adaptation and range expansion. Here we show in a group of allopolyploid species in the genus Aegilops that range size and abundance are correlated with the number of inferred origins. We found that allopolyploid Aegilops spp. contain multiple chloroplast haplotypes, each identical to haplotypes of the diploid progenitor species, indicating multiple origins as the major source of variation. The number of inferred origins in each allopolyploid species was correlated to the total area occupied by the allopolyploid and the tendency for the species to be common. Additionally, we found differences in ecological tolerance among independent origins in Aegilops triuncialis. These results strongly support the hypothesis that the introduction of genetic variability by multiple origins can increase the ecological amplitude and evolutionary success of allopolyploid species.},

	abstract = {Polyploidization is a key component of plant evolution. The number of independent origins of polyploid species traditionally has been underestimated. The objective of this study was to ascertain the number of origins of a tetraploid Aegilops species. We screened 84 primer sets to identify genome-specific primer sets for the tetraploid wheat relative [Aegilops triuncialis (UUCC genome)] and its diploid progenitors [Ae. umbellulata (UU genome) and Ae. caudata (CC genome)]. Primer sets G12 and G43 were U genome-specific and D21 was a C genome-specific primer. DNA sequence comparison of the G43 locus was used to estimate the number of polyploidization events in the formation of Ae. triuncialis. Parsimony analysis of G43 data revealed at least two independent formations of Ae. triuncialis. In the chloroplast hotspot region, located between genes rbcL and petA, sequence analysis suggested that at least three polyploidization origins might have occurred independently. Ae. triuncialis appears to be a tetraploid derived from multiple origins with minimal genome change after its formation.},

	abstract = {Appropriate and extensive taxon sampling is one of the most important determinants of accurate phylogenetic estimation. In addition, accuracy of inferences about evolutionary processes obtained from phylogenetic analyses is improved significantly by thorough taxon sampling efforts. Many recent efforts to improve phylogenetic estimates have focused instead on increasing sequence length or the number of overall characters in the analysis, and this often does have a beneficial effect on the accuracy of phylogenetic analyses. However, phylogenetic analyses of few taxa (but each represented by many characters) can be subject to strong systematic biases, which in turn produce high measures of repeatability (such as bootstrap proportions) in support of incorrect or misleading phylogenetic results. Thus, it is important for phylogeneticists to consider both the sampling of taxa, as well as the sampling of characters, in designing phylogenetic studies. Taxon sampling also improves estimates of evolutionary parameters derived from phylogenetic trees, and is thus important for improved applications of phylogenetic analyses. Analysis of sensitivity to taxon inclusion, the possible effects of long-branch attraction, and sensitivity of parameter estimation for model-based methods should be a part of any careful and thorough phylogenetic analysis. Furthermore, recent improvements in phylogenetic algorithms and in computational power have removed many constraints on analyzing large, thoroughly sampled data sets. Thorough taxon sampling is thus one of the most practical ways to improve the accuracy of phylogenetic estimates, as well as the accuracy of biological inferences that are based on these phylogenetic trees.},

	abstract = {Scientific activities take place within the structured sets of ideas and assumptions that define a field and its practices. The conceptual framework of evolutionary biology emerged with the Modern Synthesis in the early twentieth century and has since expanded into a highly successful research program to explore the processes of diversification and adaptation. Nonetheless, the ability of that framework satisfactorily to accommodate the rapid advances in developmental biology, genomics and ecology has been questioned. We review some of these arguments, focusing on literatures (evo-devo, developmental plasticity, inclusive inheritance and niche construction) whose implications for evolution can be interpreted in two ways—one that preserves the internal structure of contemporary evolutionary theory and one that points towards an alternative conceptual framework. The latter, which we label the ‘extended evolutionary synthesis' (EES), retains the fundaments of evolutionary theory, but differs in its emphasis on the role of constructive processes in development and evolution, and reciprocal portrayals of causation. In the EES, developmental processes, operating through developmental bias, inclusive inheritance and niche construction, share responsibility for the direction and rate of evolution, the origin of character variation and organism–environment complementarity. We spell out the structure, core assumptions and novel predictions of the EES, and show how it can be deployed to stimulate and advance research in those fields that study or use evolutionary biology.},

Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

By finding similarities between sequences, scientists can infer the function of newly sequenced genes, predict new members of gene families, and explore evolutionary relationships. Now that whole genomes are being sequenced, sequence similarity searching can be used to predict the location and function of protein-coding and transcription-regulation regions in genomic DNA. Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (1, 2) is the tool most frequently used for calculating sequence similarity. BLAST comes in variations for use with different query sequences against different databases. All BLAST applications, as well as information on which BLAST program to use and other help documentation, are listed on the BLAST homepage. This chapter will focus more on how BLAST works, its output, and how both the output and program itself can be further manipulated or customized, rather than on how to use BLAST or interpret BLAST results.},

	abstract = {Background In a previous paper, we introduced MUSCLE, a new program for creating multiple alignments of protein sequences, giving a brief summary of the algorithm and showing MUSCLE to achieve the highest scores reported to date on four alignment accuracy benchmarks. Here we present a more complete discussion of the algorithm, describing several previously unpublished techniques that improve biological accuracy and / or computational complexity. We introduce a new option, MUSCLE-fast, designed for high-throughput applications. We also describe a new protocol for evaluating objective functions that align two profiles. Results We compare the speed and accuracy of MUSCLE with CLUSTALW, Progressive POA and the MAFFT script FFTNS1, the fastest previously published program known to the author. Accuracy is measured using four benchmarks: BAliBASE, PREFAB, SABmark and SMART. We test three variants that offer highest accuracy (MUSCLE with default settings), highest speed (MUSCLE-fast), and a carefully chosen compromise between the two (MUSCLE-prog). We find MUSCLE-fast to be the fastest algorithm on all test sets, achieving average alignment accuracy similar to CLUSTALW in times that are typically two to three orders of magnitude less. MUSCLE-fast is able to align 1,000 sequences of average length 282 in 21 seconds on a current desktop computer. Conclusions MUSCLE offers a range of options that provide improved speed and / or alignment accuracy compared with currently available programs.

More than a hundred centuries separate the time that Ice Age hunters are conventionally thought to have crossed a land bridge from Asia into North America and the arrival of Columbus in the Bahamas in 1492. Traditional belief has long held that earth's two hemispheres were essentially cut off from one another as a result of the post-Pleistocene meltwater-fed rising oceans that covered that bridge. The oceans, along with arctic climates and daunting terrestrial distances, formed impermeable barriers to interhemispheric communication. This viewpoint implies that the cultures of the Old World and those of the Americas developed independently. Drawing on abundant and concrete evidence to support his theory for significant pre-Columbian contacts, Jett suggests that many ancient peoples had both the seafaring capabilities and the motives to cross the oceans and, in fact, did so repeatedly and with great impact. His deep and broad work synthesizes information and ideas from archaeology, geography, linguistics, climatology, oceanography, ethnobotany, genetics, medicine, and the history of navigation and seafaring, making an innovative and persuasive multidisciplinary case for a new understanding of human societies and their diffuse but interconnected development},

	abstract = {To elucidate the genetic diversity of ten Ipomoea species, seed proteins were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and RAPD analysis. According to SDS-PAGE analysis, in total 51 different bands were identified across the studied species. The number of bands varies from 16 bands in Ipomoea cairica, to 3 bands in I. sinensis. The similarity analysis based on the SDS-PAGE profile turned out to be a useful character for the inequity of Ipomoea species both on the subgeneric and sectional level. Analysis of RAPD-PCR of DNA provided more precise information concerning relationships between Ipomoea sections than SDS-PAGE analysis. A remarkable result from this study was identifying a close relationship between Ipomoea purpurea of section Pharbitis (subgenus Ipomoea) and species of the subgenus Quamoclit. Further support comes from the molecular data of RAPD which indicate that Ipomoea cairica should be considered a well separated section which may be related to section Orthipomoea. Our results suggest that section Erpipomoea is not a monophyletic group, whereas species of section Orthipomoea form a single monophyletic section.},

El nuevo mundo aporta al viejo mundo plantas y frutos que, tras aclimatarse, contribuyeron a mejorar la alimentación de los europeos y, a partir del siglo XVIII, comenzaron el proceso que pondría fin a milenarias hambrunas: papa/patata y maíz, principalmente. La batata tuvo mucha menor importancia en el ámbito alimentario europeo, aunque sí tuvo una excepcional relevancia en nuestra ciudad y provincia, puesto que se convirtió en la edad moderna, en el producto malagueño por antonomasia. Asimismo, es particularmente interesante el singular fenómeno lingüístico del término patata, que viaja en el tiempo para significar durante más de dos siglos igual que batata y, desde mediados del s. XVIII, significa lo mismo que el tubérculo andino papa, con cuyo nombre de patata lo conocemos hoy.},

Three species of gamma-GTP were isolated from bovine kidney by DEAE-cellulose chromatography, whereas only two species were isolated from bovine hepatocellular carcinoma. The carcinoma lacked the least acidic enzyme species. Appropriate gamma-glutamyl group acceptors stimulated more-acidic enzyme species more than less-acidic species in both tissues. The fractions separated from the hepatoma were stimulated more than those of kidney by gamma-glutamyl group acceptor. The enzymes from normal tissues responded similarly to a gamma-glutamyl group acceptor irrespective of the difference in their activity. Thus, gamma-GTPs of malignant tissues appear to be more versatile for amino acid transport, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In these properties the enzyme of mouse fetal liver which showed the highest activity in the last period of pregnancy resembled the enzymes of malignant rather than normal tissues. The activity of hepatic gamma-GTP is not parallel with the rate of cell proliferation during normal development.},

However, with NGS, came its own challenges that require continuous development in the sequencing technologies and bioinformatics analysis of the resultant raw data and assembly of the full length genome and transcriptome. Such developments lead to outstanding improvements of the performance and coverage of sequencing and improved quality for the assembled sequences, nevertheless, challenges such as sequencing errors, expensive processing and memory usage for assembly and sequencer specific errors remains major challenges in the field. This book aims to provide brief overviews the NGS field with special focus on the challenges facing the NGS field, including information on different experimental platforms, assembly algorithms and software tools, assembly error correction approaches and the correlated challenges.–},

	abstract = {Comparison of relative fixation rates of synonymous (silent) and nonsynonymous (amino acid-altering) mutations provides a means for understanding the mechanisms of molecular sequence evolution. The nonsynonymous/synonymous rate ratio (omega = d(N)d(S)) is an important indicator of selective pressure at the protein level, with omega = 1 meaning neutral mutations, omega {\textbackslash}textless 1 purifying selection, and omega {\textbackslash}textgreater 1 diversifying positive selection. Amino acid sites in a protein are expected to be under different selective pressures and have different underlying omega ratios. We develop models that account for heterogeneous omega ratios among amino acid sites and apply them to phylogenetic analyses of protein-coding DNA sequences. These models are useful for testing for adaptive molecular evolution and identifying amino acid sites under diversifying selection. Ten data sets of genes from nuclear, mitochondrial, and viral genomes are analyzed to estimate the distributions of omega among sites. In all data sets analyzed, the selective pressure indicated by the omega ratio is found to be highly heterogeneous among sites. Previously unsuspected Darwinian selection is detected in several genes in which the average omega ratio across sites is {\textbackslash}textless1, but in which some sites are clearly under diversifying selection with omega {\textbackslash}textgreater 1. Genes undergoing positive selection include the beta-globin gene from vertebrates, mitochondrial protein-coding genes from hominoids, the hemagglutinin (HA) gene from human influenza virus A, and HIV-1 env, vif, and pol genes. Tests for the presence of positively selected sites and their subsequent identification appear quite robust to the specific distributional form assumed for omega and can be achieved using any of several models we implement. However, we encountered difficulties in estimating the precise distribution of omega among sites from real data sets.},

The programs may be used to compare and test phylogenetic trees, but their main strengths lie in the rich repertoire of evolutionary models implemented, which can be used to estimate parameters in models of sequence evolution and to test interesting biological hypotheses. Uses of the programs include estimation of synonymous and nonsynonymous rates (d(N) and d(S)) between two protein-coding DNA sequences, inference of positive Darwinian selection through phylogenetic comparison of protein-coding genes, reconstruction of ancestral genes and proteins for molecular restoration studies of extinct life forms, combined analysis of heterogeneous data sets from multiple gene loci, and estimation of species divergence times incorporating uncertainties in fossil calibrations. This note discusses some of the major applications of the package, which includes example data sets to demonstrate their use.

We use coalescent simulations to show that the likelihood-ratio test statistic is conservative, particularly when the assumption of no recombination is violated. Application of the method to polymorphism data from 18 loci from a population of Arabidopsis lyrata provides significant evidence for a balanced polymorphism at a candidate locus thought to be linked to the centromere.

	abstract = {When polymorphism and divergence data are available for multiple loci, extended forms of the McDonald-Kreitman test can be used to estimate the average proportion of the amino acid divergence due to adaptive evolution–a statistic denoted alpha. But such tests are subject to many biases. Most serious is the possibility that high estimates of alpha reflect demographic changes rather than adaptive substitution. Testing for between-locus variation in alpha is one possible way of distinguishing between demography and selection. However, such tests have yielded contradictory results, and their efficacy is unclear. Estimates of alpha from the same model organisms have also varied widely. This study clarifies the reasons for these discrepancies, identifying several method-specific biases in widely used estimators and assessing the power of the methods. As part of this process, a new maximum-likelihood estimator is introduced. This estimator is applied to a newly compiled data set of 115 genes from Drosophila simulans, each with each orthologs from D. melanogaster and D. yakuba. In this way, it is estimated that alpha approximately 0.4+/-0.1, a value that does not vary substantially between different loci or over different periods of divergence. The implications of these results are discussed.},

This signature can be used to estimate the time since fixation from patterns of polymorphism in extant individuals. I introduce a method to assess the support in polymorphism data for a recent episode of directional positive selection and to estimate the time since fixation. I summarize the polymorphism data by three statistics that carry information about levels of diversity, the allele frequency spectrum, and the extent of allelic associations. Simulations are then used to obtain a sample from the posterior distribution of the time since fixation, conditional on the observed summaries. I test the performance of the approach on simulated data and apply it to the gene tb1 in maize. The data support the recent fixation of a favored allele, consistent with what is known about the importance of tb1 in the domestication process of maize.},

	abstract = {The theory of genetic hitchhiking predicts that the level of genetic variation is greatly reduced at the site of strong directional selection and increases as the recombinational distance from the site of selection increases. This characteristic pattern can be used to detect recent directional selection on the basis of DNA polymorphism data. However, the large variance of nucleotide diversity in samples of moderate size imposes difficulties in detecting such patterns. We investigated the patterns of genetic variation along a recombining chromosome by constructing ancestral recombination graphs that are modified to incorporate the effect of genetic hitchhiking. A statistical method is proposed to test the significance of a local reduction of variation and a skew of the frequency spectrum caused by a hitchhiking event. This method also allows us to estimate the strength and the location of directional selection from DNA sequence data.},

	abstract = {The distribution of fitness effects of new mutations (DFE) is important for addressing several questions in genetics, including the nature of quantitative variation and the evolutionary fate of small populations. Properties of the DFE can be inferred by comparing the distributions of the frequencies of segregating nucleotide polymorphisms at selected and neutral sites in a population sample, but demographic changes alter the spectrum of allele frequencies at both neutral and selected sites, so can bias estimates of the DFE if not accounted for. We have developed a maximum-likelihood approach, based on the expected allele-frequency distribution generated by transition matrix methods, to estimate parameters of the DFE while simultaneously estimating parameters of a demographic model that allows a population size change at some time in the past. We tested the method using simulations and found that it accurately recovers simulated parameter values, even if the simulated demography differs substantially from that assumed in our analysis. We use our method to estimate parameters of the DFE for amino acid-changing mutations in humans and Drosophila melanogaster. For a model of unconditionally deleterious mutations, with effects sampled from a gamma distribution, the mean estimate for the distribution shape parameter is approximately 0.2 for human populations, which implies that the DFE is strongly leptokurtic. For Drosophila populations, we estimate that the shape parameter is approximately 0.35. Differences in the shape of the distribution and the mean selection coefficient between humans and Drosophila result in significantly more strongly deleterious mutations in Drosophila than in humans, and, conversely, nearly neutral mutations are significantly less frequent.},

We detect positive selection, purifying ("negative") selection, and population expansion in our experiment. We also present a statistical test that is able to distinguish demographic from selective events, processes that are hard to identify individually because both often produce an excess of rare mutations. Our "heterogeneity test" modifies common statistics measuring the frequency spectrum of polymorphism (e.g., Fu and Li's D) by looking for processes producing different patterns on nonsynonymous and synonymous mutations. Test results agree with the known conditions of the experiment, and we are therefore confident that this test offers a tool to evaluate natural populations. Our results suggest that instances of segregating deleterious mutations may be common, but as yet undetected, in nature.},

However, abiotic and biotic stress limits bean yields to {\textbackslash}textless600 kg ha􀃭1 in low-income countries. Current low yields result in food insecurity, while demands for increased yields to match the rate of population growth combined with the threat of climate change are significant. Novel and significant advances in genetic improvement using untapped genetic diversity available in crop wild relatives and closely related species must be further explored. A meeting was organized by the Global Crop Diversity Trust to consider strategies for common bean improvement. This review resulted from that meeting and considers our current understanding of the genetic resources available for common bean improvement and the progress that has been achieved thus far through introgression of genetic diversity from wild relatives of common bean, and from closely related species, including: P. acutifolius, P. coccineus, P. costaricensis and P. dumosus. Newly developed genomic tools and their potential applications are presented. A broad outline of research for use of these genetic resources for common bean improvement in a ten-year multi-disciplinary effort is presented.},

	abstract = {Human civilization is based on agricultural domestication and cultivation. Evolution of crop plants from their hardy wild progenitors involved massive erosion of the original genetic resources, especially during modern agriculture, making the crops vulnerable and susceptible to abiotic and biotic environmental stresses. The wild relatives are the best hope for crop improvement because of their adaptive complexes to abiotic and biotic stresses. This is especially important in a world where the population and food demands are still increasing. Here, I briefly review the studies conducted at the Institute of Evolution, University of Haifa, during 1975-2007 on the ecological genomics and adaptive complexes of wild emmer wheat, Triticum dicoccoides, the progenitor of most wheat, and wild barley, Hordeum spontaneum, the progenitor of cultivated barley. We explored adaptive fitness components and genetic resources of wild cereal genotypes and populations in their center of origin and diversity in the Near East Fertile Crescent. Likewise, we established genetically and agronomically evaluated gene banks in situ and ex situ based on wild populations to safeguard precious genetic resources from disappearing. These include the unique population and species genetic structure and diversity, adaptive phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of salt-, drought-, and disease-resistances as adaptive complexes, as well as domestication QTL and chromosomal organization. These in situ and ex situ resources could be used for cereal improvement and offer the best hope for future breeding programs.},

	abstract = {A survey for sweet potato viruses was conducted in 32 farmer’s fields in Mbinga and Songea districts of the Ruvuma region in Southern Tanzania. Plants showing virus-like symptoms were observed in 25 out of 32 fields examined. Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) incidence was low in Mbinga district (16.7\%) on average and ranged from 3 to 50\% while in Songea district incidence averaged 33\% and ranged from 3 to 100\%. SPVD incidence difference between the two districts was not statistically significant (P {\textbackslash}textgreater 0.05) except among sweet potato cultivars (P{\textbackslash}textless 0.05). Sweet potato virus disease severity significantly (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) varied between the district with Mbinga having the lowest (2.38 ± 0.2) and Songea the highest (3.26 ± 0.12) mean severity score. SPVD severity score also significantly varied among sweet potato cultivars (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) with cultivar ‘‘Jeshi’’ displaying the most severe symptoms (4.2 ± 0.37 severity score) and ‘Wino’ and ‘Madaresalama expressing the mildest symptoms (2.0 ± 0.00). Twenty foliar samples from infected plants were tested serologically for Sweet potato chlorotic stunt virus (SPCSV), Sweetpotato feathery mottle virus (SPFMV), Sweet potato mild mottle virus (SPMMV), Sweet potato chlorotic fleck virus (SPCFV), Sweet potato calico-like virus (SPCaLV), Sweet potato mild speckling virus (SPMSV), C-6 (a new flexious rod virus), Sweet potato latent virus (SwPLV), Sweet potato virus G (SPVG) and Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) using Nitrocelullose Membrane ELISA (NCM-ELISA). SPCFV was the most common virus detected followed by SPCSV. SPVG was detected in seven samples representing the first report of its occurrence in Tanzania. SwPLV, C-6, CMV and SPCaLV were not detected. Whitefly population was low and aphids were rarely found in most of the fields. Orange-fleshed sweet potato cultivars grown in the surveyed areas also displayed SPVD symptoms with high incidence and severity. These results indicate that SPVD situation in Tanzania is not uniform in the major sweet potato growing areas and the significance of this virus diversity needs to be investigated.},

	abstract = {This report synthesizes information gathered from nearly 900 farmers in surveys carried out between 1991 and 1993 in selected areas of Tanzania. The information obtained is intended to improve the relevance of research planning and priority setting for the increased production and marketing of sweetpotato. Sample areas were chosen to represent different agro-climatic zones, soil characteristics, topography, and social cultural conditions. Sweetpotato is grown throughout Tanzania. Nationally, it is the third most important root and tuber crop after cassava and round (Solanum) potato. In national food production, it ranks fourth after maize, cassava, and beans. The crop plays an important role in household food security and is produced mainly for home consumption. It occupies approximately 14\% of the total arable land of the farms surveyed. The crop is most important in the Lake and Eastern Zones, moderately important in Southern highlands and Northern zones; and less important in the southern and Central zones. Average yields of fresh sweetpotato storage roots are very low- a rough estimate of the mean yield at farm level is 5.5 tons per hectare. Sweetpotato roots are primarily consumed fresh, most usually just boiled, although they are also roasted and used as an ingredient in some traditional dishes. Processing into sun-dried chips or slices, termed Matoborwa and Michembe, is common in the Lake Zone, but is completely unknown in the Northern Zone. Storage of fresh roots in pits is common in the Southern highlands zone. Leaves are used as a vegetable mainly in Central and Southern Zones, and as fodder in Northern Zone. A major production constraint is the susceptibility of many of the varieties currently grown to sweetpotato weevils and diseases. Improved characteristics which farmers would like to see include: good root-cooking characteristics, extended in ground storability, high market value, and drought tolerance. Major constraints limiting production in the order of importance mentioned by farmers include: sweetpotato weevils (Cylas spp. and Blocyrus spp.), drought, shortage of planting material, low roots yield, vertebrate pest (moles, rats, pigs), viral and fungal diseases, poor market accessibility, storage pest (larger grain borers), and low soil fertility. Sweetpotato is about equally likely to be grown as a sole crop or as an intercrop. Maize, cassava, and beans are the most common intercrops with sweetpotato. Harvesting is mainly carried out piecemeal, a few roots at a time, over an extended harvest period. Female farmers play a big role in sweetpotato production, processing, and marketing activities. A priority for research is the development of sweetpotato varieties with resistance to pest and disease, high yields, and good root characteristics. Drought-tolerant varieties combined with early planting to avoid dry spells could alleviate widespread crop loss due to drought. Techniques in rapid multiplication of sweetpotato planting material should be extended to farmers and village extensionists for the sustainable and reliable supply of planting material. Post-harvest handling techniques should be improved to minimize losses. Diversified use of sweetpotato and the development of new products which use the crop as an ingredient would open up new markets, which in urn would be an incentive to farmers to increase productivity per unit area.},

	abstract = {Jatropha curcas is a multipurpose plant with many attributes and considerable potential. It is a tropical plant that can be grown in low to high rainfall areas and can be used to reclaim land, as a hedge and/or as a commercial crop. Thus, growing it could provide employment, improve the environment and enhance the quality of rural life. The establishment, management and productivity of jatropha under various climatic conditions are not fully documented. This is discussed and the gaps in the knowledge elucidated, especially its fertilizer requirements. The plant produces many useful products, especially the seed, from which oil can be extracted; this oil has similar properties to palm oil. The costs and returns of growing the plant and producing the plant oil are discussed and tabulated. Because it can be used in place of kerosene and diesel and as a substitute for fuelwood, it has been promoted to make rural areas self sucient in fuels for cooking, lighting and motive power. This strategy is examined and found not viable. Oil for soap making is the most pro®table use. It is concluded that all markets for jatropha products should be investigated. If the full potential of the plant is to be realized, much more research is required into the growing and management of Jatropha curcas and more information is needed on the actual and potential markets for all its products.},

	abstract = {Imported from the Andean region to Europe in the 16th century, today tomato is widespread throughout the world and represents the most economically important vegetable crop worldwide. Tomato is not only traded in the fresh market but is also used in the processing industry in soups, as paste, concentrate, juice, and ketchup. It is an incredible source of important nutrients such as lycopene, β-carotene and vitamin C, which all have positive impacts on human health. Its production and consumption is increasing with population growth. In this review, we report how tomato was already domesticated by the ancient Incan and Aztec civilizations, and how it came to Europe, where its breeding history started. The development of genetic, molecular biology and plant biotechnology have opened the doors towards the modern genetic engineering of tomato. The different goals of tomato genetic engineering are presented, as well as examples of successfully engineered tomatoes in terms of resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and fruit quality. The development of GM tomato for biopharming is also described.},

	abstract = {Available evidence shows that sweetpotato originated from either Central or South American lowlands with subsequent dispersal to North America, Europe, Africa, Asia and the pacific islands. A total of 71 polymorphic RAPD molecular markers were used to assess the genetic relationships amongst 74 sweetpotato varieties originating from a total of 23 sweetpotato producing countries within six geographical regions, namely, South America, Central America/Caribbean, United States of America (USA), East Africa, Asia and Oceania. An Analysis of Molecular Variance (AMOVA) indicated that 93.4\% of the total variance was due to the differences between genotypes within regions. The difference between regions was significant (P {\textbackslash}textless 0.001) but only contributed 6.6\% to the variance. Genetic distance (PhiST) calculated with AMOVA and multidimensional scaling (MDS) revealed that the South American and the Central American/Caribbean genotypes formed two separate clusters. East African varieties, which have unique characteristics from other traditional varieties, were distinct from other traditional varieties from South America and Oceania. These results support the reported hypothesis of the origin and dispersal of the sweetpotato and indicate that the primary centre of diversity probably has two distinct genepools. It is proposed that the dispersal of the sweetpotato from its origin may have mainly involved varieties from Central America/Caribbean as opposed to varieties from South America. There is an indication that new genepools may be evolving in Africa and Asia due to hybridisation and adaptation to the local environments.},

Throughout the world Ipomoea is usually estimated to contain c. 500 species (e.g., Mabberley, 1989; McDonald \& Mabry, 1992). After our compilation, we believe Ipomoea is more likely to contain 600-700 species. Over half of them are concentrated in the Americas, where the total may approach 500 taxa, mostly native and a few introduced. Although there are recent publications dealing with Ipomoea in the floras of several American countries (O'Donell, 1941-1960b; Austin, 1975-1991b; Austin \& Cavalcante, 1982; Austin \& al., 1986; McDonald, unpubl. thesis 1978, unpubl. diss. 1982, 1982-1995; McDonald \& Austin, 1990; McDonald \& Mabry, 1992; Wilkin, 1995), there is no single reference summarizing all the species currently recognized in the western hemisphere. The purpose of this publication is to make available an updated list with relationships of American Ipomoea species examined thus far. There certainly are more species in the Americas than recognized here, especially in Brazil, Bolivia and Paraguay, but many of these have not been studied since Meisner (1869). Moreover, there are species remaining undescribed and/or undiscovered. Infrageneric placement is given, where known, and a documented American geographical range is provided for each species.},

Senecio inghamii Montesinos has oblanceolate-ovate to rhombic-quadrate leaves, short-sized, with serrate-quadrate dentation, upper surface lustrous and glossy, lower surface densely covered with whitish lanuginose pubescence, capitules bear trilobulated ray florets, achenes copiously covered by fimbriate hairs which differentiates it from its closest relative, S. pensilis Greenm. Senecio roseoandinus Montesinos \& R. Zárate is a unique pubescent species characterized for being a perennial rhizomatous herb, with lanuginose and arachnoid trichomes, leaves elliptic-lanceolate, thick, densely arachnoid to glabrous (lustrous, glossy, dark green), margin entire to crenate, synflorescence in racemes, capitules discoid, corolla pale yellow but turning fuchsia-pink at maturity, achenes oblong, striate, and glabrous. All three new species are distributed in the Alto Marañon river mountain slopes, at altitudes ranging from 2000 up to 4200 m a.s.l.

	abstract = {The plant species that humans rely upon have an extended family of wild counterparts that are an important source of genetic diversity used to breed productive crops. These wild and weedy cousins are valuable as a resource for adapting our food, forage, industrial and other crops to climate change. Many wild plant species are also directly used, especially for revegetation, and as medicinal and ornamental plants. North America is rich in these wild plant genetic resources. This book is a valuable reference that describes the important crop wild relatives and wild utilized species found in Canada, the United States and Mexico. The book highlights efforts taken by these countries to conserve and use wild resources and provides essential information on best practices for collecting and conserving them. Numerous maps using up-to-date information and methods illustrate the distribution of important species, and supplement detailed description on the potential value these resources have to agriculture, as well as their conservation statuses and needs. There is broad recognition of the urgent need to conserve plant diversity; however, a small fraction of wild species is distinguished by their potential to support agricultural production. Many of these species are common, even weedy, and are easily overshadowed by rare or endangered plants. Nevertheless, because of their genetic proximity to agriculturally important crops or direct use, they deserve to be recognized, celebrated, conserved, and made available to support food and agricultural security. This comprehensive two-volume reference will be valuable for students and scientists interested in economic botany, and for practitioners at all levels tasked with conserving plant biodiversity.},

	abstract = {Cultivated potatoes (Solanum tuberosum L.), domesticated from wild Solanum species native to the Andes of southern Peru, possess a diverse gene pool representing more than 100 tuber-bearing relatives (Solanum section Petota). A diversity panel of wild species, landraces, and cultivars was sequenced to assess genetic variation within tuber-bearing Solanum and the impact of domestication on genome diversity and identify key loci selected for cultivation in North and South America. Sequence diversity of diploid and tetraploid S. tuberosum exceeded any crop resequencing study to date, in part due to expanded wild introgressions following polyploidy that captured alleles outside of their geographic origin. We identified 2,622 genes as under selection, with only 14–16\% shared by North American and Andean cultivars, showing that a limited gene set drove early improvement of cultivated potato, while adaptation of upland (S. tuberosum group Andigena) and lowland (S. tuberosum groups Chilotanum and Tuberosum) populations targeted distinct loci. Signatures of selection were uncovered in genes controlling carbohydrate metabolism, glycoalkaloid biosynthesis, the shikimate pathway, the cell cycle, and circadian rhythm. Reduced sexual fertility that accompanied the shift to asexual reproduction in cultivars was reflected by signatures of selection in genes regulating pollen development/gametogenesis. Exploration of haplotype diversity at potato’s maturity locus (StCDF1) revealed introgression of truncated alleles from wild species, particularly S. microdontum in long-day–adapted cultivars. This study uncovers a historic role of wild Solanum species in the diversification of long-day–adapted tetraploid potatoes, showing that extant natural populations represent an essential source of untapped adaptive potential.},

The 21 invasive species found by us represent 10\% of the 201 introduced vascular plant species on Fuerteventura. Although up to now the damage to natural ecosystems has been limited, the monitoring of invasive plants is necessary in order to prevent the invasion of areas harbouring remnants of natural vegetation.

Paracytic stomata and multicellular, glandular and unicellular, eglandular trichomes occur on both the leaves and stem. Bicollateral bundles comprise the midrib and major veins, while the minor veins consist of collateral bundles. A petiole base possesses two adaxial collateral bundles and one or two abaxial bicollateral bundles. The lamina has well-defined palisade and spongy mesophyll layers. Development of stem vasculature of this twining vine may be separated into five ontogenetic stages, namely: the bicollateral bundle stage, the cambium-like meristem stage, the normal cambial stage, the anomalous cambial stage and the supernumerary cambial stage. The primary vasculature of the stem consists of bicollateral bundles. Within these bundles the external protophloem becomes separated from the protoxylem and internal phloem by a cambium-like meristem that produces cylinders of external metaphloem and metaxylem. A cambium then arises between the external phloem and the primary xylem and produces secondary phloem centrifugally and secondary xylem centripetally. Lobed, concentric and foraminate patterns of anomalous secondary growth subsequently develop in a stem. The lobed pattern develops as the cambium undergoes differential activity on opposing sides of the stem, while a concentric pattern results from the activity of a discontinuous supernumerary cambium. A foraminate pattern develops as included phloem forms within parenchymatous islands of the secondary xylem. Ipomoea quamoclit possesses a taproot whose outer boundary is a periderm of subepidermal origin. A foraminate pattern of anomalous secondary growth develops within this root.},

	abstract = {The genus Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae) has a sporophytic self-incompatibility system that is under the genetic control of a single multiallelic S-locus. Self-incompatibility reactions occur on the stigma surface at an early stage after pollination, and result in the complete arrest of pollen germination such that no seed is set. In a genetic analysis of 224 plants of diploid I. trifida, collected from six native populations in Central America, we identified 49 different S-alleles that showed a linear dominance-recessive hierarchy. We also obtained a spontaneous self-compatible mutant and showed that this self-compatibility trait is due to mutation at the S-locus. To investigate the molecular basis of sporophytic self-incompatibility in Ipomoea, we analysed stigma proteins and mRNAs extracted from several different S-genotypes, using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) and AFLP-based mRNA fingerprinting (AMF), respectively. From the 2D-PAGE analyses, S-locus-linked stigma proteins (SSPs) were identified. The amino acid sequences of these proteins have a high homology to non-metallo short-chain alcohol dehydrogenases reported in several plant species. The SSP gene was mapped at a distance of 1·2 cM from the S-locus. In the AMF analysis, we obtained a clone homologous to the Brassica SRK, which showed no genetic linkage to the S-locus of Ipomoea. This suggests that the sporophytic self-incompatibility system of Ipomoea is mediated through a different molecular mechanism to that of Brassica.},

Lam.] and its putative tetraploid and diploid ancestors, and to test possible microsatellite mutation mechanisms in polyploids by direct sequencing of alleles. Sixty three microsatellite loci were isolated from genomic libraries of I. batatas and sequenced. PCR primers were designed and used to characterize microsatellite loci in two hexaploid I. batatas populations, a tetraploid Ipomoea trifida population, and a diploid I. trifida population. Nine out of the sixty three primer pairs tested yielded a clearly discernible, heritable banding pattern; five showed Mendelian segregation. All other primer pairs produced either smeared banding patterns, which could not be scored, or no bands at all in I. batatas. All of the primers which produced discernible banding patterns from I. batatas also amplified products of similar size in tetraploid and diploid I. trifida accessions. The sequence analysis of several alleles in the three species showed differences due to mutations in the repeat regions consistent with small differences in the repeat number. However, in some cases insertions/deletions and base substitutions in the microsatellite flanking regions were responsible for polymorphisms in both polyploid and diploid species. These results provide strong empirical evidence that complex genetic mechanisms are responsible for SSR allelic variation in Ipomoea. Four I. batatas microsatellite loci showed polysomic segregation fitting tetraploid segregation ratios. To our knowledge this is the first report of segregation ratios for microsatellites markers in polyploids.},

	abstract = {Crossability within Ipomoea section Batatas is complex because of genetic, cytogenetic and physiological interactions. This complexity is responsible for the fact that knowledge about phylogenetic relationships within this section remains preliminary. Between 1988 and 1991, studies of planting, pollination and evaluation of progenies were carried out at the facilities of CIP in La Molina and San Ramon, Peru. Self-compatibility was found in nine diploid species. Self-incompatibility was found in diploid I. trifida, tetraploid I. tiliacea and both tetraploid and hexaploid I. batatas. Sexual compatibility is though to be related to a multiallelic sporophytic incompatibility system which is expressed in the stigmatic papillae. Altogether, 4,162 cross pollinations were made between 11 species and 76 interspecific combinations of 110 possible combinations in a diallel 11×11 design. From these 76 interspecific combinations only 38 survived, and in these crossability (= proportion between number of fruits harvested/pollinations made) ranged from 0.01 to 1.00 at La Molina. At San Ramon, 11 out of 17 cross combinations were successful, and in these crossability ranged from 0.01 to 0.71. Crossability appeared to be influenced by latitude which is related to flowering synchrony. The early death of seedlings is hypothesized to be related to a genomic imbalance between embryo and endosperm. Maternal effects were found in crosses between diploids and tetraploids which produced triploid and diploid offspring, and in crosses between hexaploids and diploids which gave rise to hexaploid offspring. This study shows that I. trifida and I. x leucantha may act as “bridge species” for gene flow from wild Ipomoea species to the genepool of the sweetpotato.},

These groups are consistent with results of previous analyses, save for the novel placement of I. tiliacea, among the A-genome species. Sequences specific to both A and B genome species have been identified. Exon sequences indicate that I. ramosissima and I. umbraticola are quite different from other A-genome species. Placement of I. littoralis is questionable; its intron is similar to other B-genome species, but its exons are quite different. Exon evolution indicates that the B-genome has evolved faster than the A-genome.

Information of genetic diversity in Papua New Guinea (PNG) sweetpotato is essential for rationalizing the global sweetpotato germplasm collection. Using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), we compared the genetic variation and genetic diversity in 18 PNG cultivars versus 18 cultivars from South America. The analysis of molecular variance revealed large genetic diversity in both groups of cultivars. The within-group (among individuals) variation accounted for 90.6\% of the total molecular variance. However, the difference between PNG and South American groups is statistically significant, although it explained only 9.4\% of the total molecular variance. The PNG cultivars are also less divergent than their South American ancestors as the mean genetic distance in PNG group is significantly smaller than that of South American group. The lower level of genetic diversity in PNG cultivars was also reflected by multidimensional scaling. This study shows that PNG cultivars, after many years of isolated evolution in an unique agro-ecological environment are substantially divergent from their ancestors in South America. The genetic diversity level in PNG cultivars is significantly lower than that in South American cultivars. It thus provides a baseline for continuing studies of genetic diversity in different sweetpotato gene pools.},

Ipomoea lacunosa and I. cordatotriloba , along with a putative homoploid hybrid, I. × leucantha , are closely related taxa, which are promising for investigating the early stages of speciation. The objectives of this investigation were to determine how distinct these purported taxa are morphologically and genetically, and to assess the magnitude of reproductive isolation among the taxa. • Methods: We measured morphological characteristics and determined genotypes at four microsatellite loci in several populations of each of the taxa in North Carolina and South Carolina to quantify genetic and morphological differentiation. We also included a previously undescribed fourth taxon, which we term ‘ I. austinii ’. • Key results: Our study revealed that all four taxa had distinct but overlapping geographical ranges, and had significantly distinct morphologies. Patterns of microsatellite variation and the results of crosses indicate that I. × leucantha and I. austinii are morphologically and genetically distinct taxa. Each exhibits substantial reproductive isolation from the other three taxa. By contrast, microsatellite markers indicate that I. lacunosa and I. cordatotriloba exhibit little differentiation at neutral markers, despite substantial morphological differentiation, and exhibit some reproductive isolation. • Conclusion: I. × leucantha and I. austinii should be considered separate species. Our results provide no evidence that either species originated through homoploid hybrid speciation. I. cordatotriloba and I. lacunosa should be considered incipient species, but may be experiencing considerable reciprocal gene flow.},

Uncertainty in regard to species boundaries and their phylogenetic relationships, the limited availability of germplasm with which to perform crosses, and the difficulty of introgression of genes from wild species has constrained their utilization. Here we compile geographic occurrence data on relevant sweetpotato wild relatives and produce potential distribution models for the species. We then assess the comprehensiveness of ex situ germplasm collections, contextualize these results with research and breeding priorities, and use ecogeographic information to identify species with the potential to contribute desirable agronomic traits. The fourteen species that are considered the closest wild relatives of sweetpotato generally occur from the central United States to Argentina, with richness concentrated in Mesoamerica and in the extreme southeastern United States. Currently designated species differ among themselves and in comparison to the crop in their adaptations to temperature, precipitation, and edaphic characteristics and most species also show considerable intraspecific variation. With 79\% of species identified as high priority for further collecting, we find that these crop genetic resources are highly under-represented in ex situ conservation systems and thus their availability to breeders and researchers is inadequate. We prioritize taxa and specific geographic locations for further collecting in order to improve the completeness of germplasm collections. In concert with enhanced conservation of sweetpotato wild relatives, further taxonomic research, characterization and evaluation of germplasm, and improving the techniques to overcome barriers to introgression with wild species are needed in order to mobilize these genetic resources for crop breeding.},

Phylogenetic studies demonstrated that the largest morning glory genus, Ipomoea , is not monophyletic, and nine other genera are derived from within Ipomoea . Therefore, systematic research is focused on the monophyletic tribe Ipomoeeae (ca. 650–900 species). We used whole plastomes to infer relationships across Ipomoeeae. • Methods: Whole plastomes were sequenced for 29 morning glory species, representing major lineages. Phylogenies were estimated using alignments of 82 plastid genes and whole plastomes. Divergence times were estimated using three fossil calibration points. Finally, evolution of root architecture, fl ower color, and ergot alkaloid presence was examined. • Key results: Phylogenies estimated from both data sets had nearly identical topologies. Phylogenetic results are generally consistent with prior phylogenetic hypotheses. Higher-level relationships with weak support in previous studies were recovered here with strong support. Molecular dating analysis suggests a late Eocene divergence time for the Ipomoeeae. The two clades within the tribe, Argyreiinae and Astripomoeinae, diversifi ed at similar times. Reconstructed most recent common ancestor of the Ipomoeeae had blue flowers, an association with ergot-producing fungi, and either tuberous or fibrous roots. • Conclusions: Phylogenetic results provide confidence in relationships among Ipomoeeae lineages. Divergence time estimation results provide a temporal context for diversification of morning glories. Ancestral character reconstructions support previous findings that morning glory morphology is evolutionarily labile. Taken together, our study provides strong resolution of the morning glory phylogeny, which is broadly applicable to the evolution and ecology of these fascinating species.},

The phylogeny of 40 species representing the three currently recognized subgenera and nine sections within the genus was analyzed using sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and sequences for three exons and two introns of the 3' end of the nuclear gene waxy. Nucleotide data from each gene or region were analyzed singly and in combination using parsimony. Exon and intron sequences from the relatively unexplored waxy gene provided appreciable levels of site mutations, and intron sequences revealed several phylogenetically informative deletions. ITS provided greater resolution and was largely congruent with waxy. Combined analyses using Merremia and Operculina as outgroups showed strong support for two major clades, including a novel assemblage of four Old World species and a larger clade composed of the remaining sample. Within the larger clade were numerous well-supported subclades, several of which corresponded to previously recognized taxonomic groups. Higher level hierarchical relationships within the two clades and the among the subclades did not support the most recent classification scheme, which divides Ipomoea into three subgenera, Ipomoea, Quamoclit, and Eriospermum. A striking result from this study was identifying a close relationship between species of section Pharbitis (subgenus Ipomoea) and species of subgenus Quamoclit. This clade is comprised of taxa with a broad range of morphological diversity, implying both floral and vegetative morphology may have been evolutionarily labile within the genus. The composition of three clades consisting largely of species of subg. Eriospermum suggests a novel set of relationships between New World and Australian species. Several clades identified in this study are prime candidates for future studies of character evolution, including several putative cases of independent pigment transformations of red and white flowers from purple flowers.},

For the first time, we report on the nrDNA ITS sequences isolated from I. batatas ‘Xushu18’ and its relative wild species (I. triloba (DOM), I. cordatotriloba (MEX), I. nil (PER), I. nil (JPN), I. hederacea Jacq. (USA), I. hederacea Jacq. (HK)), an interspecific hybrid 67-1 (I. batatas ‘Xushu18’ × I. hederacea Jacq.), and a backcross line (67-1 × I. batatas ‘Xushu18’). Analysis showed that the nrDNA ITS sequences ranged from 570 bp to 600 bp. Among them, the ITS1 fragments ranged from 185 bp to 209 bp, with GC content of 53.11\%-61.83\%; the ITS2 regions ranged from 214 bp to 226 bp, with GC content of 61.21\%-72.89\%; the 5.8S sequences were 165 bp, with GC content of 54.55\%-55.76\%. Furthermore, the informative sites of I. batatas and its wild relatives lay in the ITS1 and ITS2 regions; in contrast to other Ipomoea germplasms, there was a 6-8 bp deletion in the ITS2 of I. wrightii. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that I. batatas ‘Xushu18’ had closer phylogenetic relationships with the wild relatives of I. triloba, I. cordatotriloba, I. lacunosa, and I. trifida than I. wrightii, I. pes-tigridis, I. grandifolia, I. nil, I. hederacea, and I. purpurea. Moreover, the interspecific hybrid and the backcross line had closer phylogenetic relationships with I. batatas ‘Xushu18’, compared to I. hederacea.},

Knowledge of the genetic structure in this collection is essential for rational germplasm conservation and utilization. Sixty-nine sweet potato cultivars from 4 geographical regions (including 13 countries) of Latin America were randomly sampled and fingerprinted using AFLP markers. A total of 210 polymorphic and clearly scorable fragments were generated. A geographic pattern of diversity distribution was revealed by mean similarity, multidimensional scaling (MDS), and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA). The highest genetic diversity was found in Central America, whereas the lowest was in Peru-Ecuador. The within-region variation was the major source of molecular variance. The between-regions variation, although it only explains 10.0\% of the total diversity, is statistically significant. Cultivars from Peru-Ecuador, with the lowest level of within region diversity, made the most significant contribution to the between region differentiation. These results support the hypothesis that Central America is the primary center of diversity and most likely the center of origin of sweet potato. Peru-Ecuador should be considered as a secondary center of sweet potato diversity.},

To combat this problem, food-based intervention is an appropriate and sustainable approach under Ethiopian circumstance along with supplementation of capsule and food fortification. Thus, orange-fleshed sweet potato (OFSP) which is rich in β-carotene has the potential to mitigate vitamin A deficiency problem. Given its high provitamin A content, low input requirements and adaptation to African farming systems, orange-fleshed sweet potatoes can make a sustainable and significant contribution to satisfy the vitamin A dietary requirement of the resource poor Ethiopian. In this regard different food product was developed in Tigray and Southern Ethiopia, from flours of OFSP blended with flours of other crops such as maize and wheat at different proportion. The developed food products were found to be rich in vitamin A content compared to the local staple food (which is poor in vitamin A) and reported to meet the daily RDA of the different age groups upon consumption of the products in the study areas. Therefore, much effort is required to popularize the crop, develop different recipes and food product which the rural community can use to combat vitamin A deficiency.},

	abstract = {he distribution, ecology and conservation status of the majority of plant species are poorly known. One of the challenges ahead is to address this knowledge gap and give more emphasis to this important group of species that represents a critical component of earth’s biodiversity. Full conservation assessments require expert knowledge of the group concerned, but for the majority of plant species, especially those from the tropics, the best source of knowledge is specimens housed within herbaria. Digitisation projects are underway to render information from this important global biodiversity resource more accessible; the next step is to assemble and utilise these data to make better informed conservation decisions. One crucial question is: how many herbarium specimens are needed to detect threatened species? Such information would inform and help to prioritise digitisation efforts. Using 11,461 herbarium records we assessed species geographic range to determine a preliminary conservation status of 661 endemic species of Leguminosae and Orchidaceae from Madagascar, following the IUCN criteria. By capturing 15 georeferenced specimens per species we produced range estimates for use in conservation assessments consistent with estimates based on all known specimens, for more than 95\% of species. None of the threatened species were misclassified as not threatened, and less than 3\% of species would receive conservation support as a result of being falsely identified as threatened. This approach can therefore help progress towards the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation target of a conservation assessment for each plant species, while reducing digitisation effort by up to half.},

However, a shortage of taxonomic information and skills, and confusion over where the limits to 'species' should be set, both cause problems for conservationists. There is no simple solution because species lists used for conservation planning (e.g. threatened species, species richness estimates, species covered by legislation) are often also used to determine which units should be the focus of conservation actions; this despite the fact that the two processes have such different goals and information needs. Species conservation needs two kinds of taxonomic solution: (i) a set of practical rules to standardize the species units included on lists; and (ii) an approach to the units chosen for conservation recovery planning which recognizes the dynamic nature of natural systems and the differences from the units in listing processes that result. These solutions are well within our grasp but require a new kind of collaboration among conservation biologists, taxonomists and legislators, as well as an increased resource of taxonomists with relevant and high-quality skills.},

These types of studies rely fundamentally on access to extensive and representative datasets (i.e., “big data”). In this study, I asses the availability of plant species occurrence records through the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) and the distribution of networked vegetation census plots in tropical South America. I analyze how the amount of available data has changed through time and the consequent changes in taxonomic, spatial, habitat, and climatic representativeness. I show that there are large and growing amounts of data available for tropical South America. Specifically, there are almost 2,000,000 unique geo-referenced collection records representing more than 50,000 species of plants in tropical South America and over 1,500 census plots. However, there is still a gaping “data void” such that many species and many habitats remain so poorly represented in either of the databases as to be functionally invisible for most studies. It is important that we support efforts to increase the availability of data, and the representativeness of these data, so that we can better predict and mitigate the impacts of anthropogenic disturbances.},

A species geographic range is the best predictor of its date of description: the two are strongly negatively correlated both across all species and within taxa, and when controlling for other variables. Altitudinal range and body mass are negatively correlated with date of description across species, and abundance and altitudinal range are negatively correlated with description date within taxa. However, the amounts of variation explained by these variables are low, and none of the variables remain significanlty correlated with date of description if geographic range is controlled for using multiple regression. Of those variables tested, species body mass is the poorest predictor of species date of description, at least in South American oscine passerine birds. Whether the visual conspicuousness (e.g. plumage and behaviour) of a species affects its probability of description remains untested.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION
There is an urgent need for a new paradigm that integrates the continued development of human societies and the maintenance of the Earth system (ES) in a resilient and accommodating state. The planetary boundary (PB) framework contributes to such a paradigm by providing a science-based analysis of the risk that human perturbations will destabilize the ES at the planetary scale. Here, the scientific underpinnings of the PB framework are updated and strengthened.

RATIONALE
The relatively stable, 11,700-year-long Holocene epoch is the only state of the ES that we know for certain can support contemporary human societies. There is increasing evidence that human activities are affecting ES functioning to a degree that threatens the resilience of the ES—its ability to persist in a Holocene-like state in the face of increasing human pressures and shocks. The PB framework is based on critical processes that regulate ES functioning. By combining improved scientific understanding of ES functioning with the precautionary principle, the PB framework identifies levels of anthropogenic perturbations below which the risk of destabilization of the ES is likely to remain low—a “safe operating space” for global societal development. A zone of uncertainty for each PB highlights the area of increasing risk. The current level of anthropogenic impact on the ES, and thus the risk to the stability of the ES, is assessed by comparison with the proposed PB (see the figure).

RESULTS
Three of the PBs (climate change, stratospheric ozone depletion, and ocean acidification) remain essentially unchanged from the earlier analysis. Regional-level boundaries as well as globally aggregated PBs have now been developed for biosphere integrity (earlier “biodiversity loss”), biogeochemical flows, land-system change, and freshwater use. At present, only one regional boundary (south Asian monsoon) can be established for atmospheric aerosol loading. Although we cannot identify a single PB for novel entities (here defined as new substances, new forms of existing substances, and modified life forms that have the potential for unwanted geophysical and/or biological effects), they are included in the PB framework, given their potential to change the state of the ES. Two of the PBs—climate change and biosphere integrity—are recognized as “core” PBs based on their fundamental importance for the ES. The climate system is a manifestation of the amount, distribution, and net balance of energy at Earth’s surface; the biosphere regulates material and energy flows in the ES and increases its resilience to abrupt and gradual change. Anthropogenic perturbation levels of four of the ES processes/features (climate change, biosphere integrity, biogeochemical flows, and land-system change) exceed the proposed PB (see the figure).

CONCLUSIONS
PBs are scientifically based levels of human perturbation of the ES beyond which ES functioning may be substantially altered. Transgression of the PBs thus creates substantial risk of destabilizing the Holocene state of the ES in which modern societies have evolved. The PB framework does not dictate how societies should develop. These are political decisions that must include consideration of the human dimensions, including equity, not incorporated in the PB framework. Nevertheless, by identifying a safe operating space for humanity on Earth, the PB framework can make a valuable contribution to decision-makers in charting desirable courses for societal development.},

	abstract = {Chlorophyllide (chlide) is a natural catabolic product of chlorophyll (Chl), produced through the activity of chlorophyllase (chlase). The growth inhibitory and antioxidant effects of chlide from different plant leaf extracts have not been reported. The aim of this study is to demonstrate that chlide in crude extracts from leaves has the potential to exert cytotoxic effects on cancer cell lines. The potential inhibitory and antioxidant effects of chlide in crude extracts from 10 plant leaves on breast cancer cells (MCF7 and MDA-MB-231), hepatocellular carcinoma cells (Hep G2), colorectal adenocarcinoma cells (Caco2), and glioblastoma cells (U-118 MG) were studied using MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and DPPH (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl) assays. The results of the MTT assay showed that chlide in crude extracts from sweet potato were the most effective against all cancer cell lines tested. U-118 MG cells were the most sensitive, while Caco2 cells were the most resistant to the tested crude extracts. The cytotoxic effects of chlide and Chl in crude extracts from sweet potato and of commercial chlorophyllin (Cu-chlin), in descending order, were as follows: chlide {\textgreater} Chl {\textgreater} Cu-chlin. Notably, the IC
              50

              μ
              g/mL) of chlide and Cu-chlin from crude extracts of sweet potato presented very similar radical scavenging activity to vitamin B2. The concentration of chlide was negatively correlated with DPPH activity. The current study was the first to demonstrate that chlide in crude extracts from leaves have potential cytotoxicity in cancer cell lines. Synergism between chlide and other compounds from leaf crude extracts may contribute to its cytotoxicity.},

The number of microsporocytes per anther ranged from 9 to 348 with the sweet potato cultivars falling midway within this range. In sweet potato, meiosis was observed to be regular in about 80\% of the cells studied with irregularities observed in the rest of the cells in the form of chromosome clumping, abnormal grouping of chromosomes, occurrence of very few chromosomes and the presence of laggards at anaphase I and II. In every cultivar, multivalents were observed during diakinesis ranging from trivalents to hexavalents. Chromosome number was found to be 2n = 90 in about 80\% of the cells observed .},

	abstract = {Field and laboratory experiments were conducted in SC, USA, in 2004/2005 and 2006/2007 to determine the effect of temperature, light, and spring burial on Ipomoea purpurea (L.) Roth. seed germination over a 12-month period after seed maturation in the field. The seed collections used for the temperature and light studies had physical dormancy (water-impermeable), with 10–23\% and 17–46\% germination, respectively, of the freshly matured viable seeds. Freshly matured seeds used for the temperature study germinated to higher percentages at 15–25 °C constant. During winter (3 months after seed maturation), seed germination was higher at 30 °C constant or 22.5/37.5 °C fluctuating. During spring (6 months after seed maturation), there was a widening of thermal range (10–40 °C constant or 2.5/17.5 to 27.5/42.5 °C fluctuating) for germination. Germination of surface-lying or buried seeds was higher at 35–40 °C constant or 22.5/37.5–27.5/42.5 °C fluctuating in late summer (9 months after maturation) and autumn (12 months after maturation). Light had minimal influence on germination of surface or buried seeds of the tested population over the 12-month after-ripening period. A temperature-mediated annual dormancy continuum of I. purpurea seed has been proposed in this research, which will contribute to the development of weed emergence models aimed at improving strategies for I. purpurea control in the field.},

Alternatively, a molecular clock approach, in which DNA or amino acid substitution rates are calibrated with fossils or geological/climatic events, can provide indirect estimates of clade ages and diversification rates. The utility of this approach depends on the rate constancy of molecular evolution at a genetic locus across time and across lineages. Although the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer region (nrITS) is increasingly being used to infer clade ages in plants, little is known about the sources or magnitude of variation in its substitution rate. Here, we systematically review the literature to assess substitution rate variation in nrITS among angiosperms, and we evaluate possible correlates of the variation.},

	abstract = {Two complementary protein extraction methodologies coupled with an automated proteomic platform were employed to analyze tissue-specific proteomes and characterize biological and metabolic processes in sweetpotato. A total of 74,255 peptides corresponding to 4,321 nonredundant proteins were successfully identified. Data were compared to predicted protein accessions for Ipomoea species and mapped on the sweetpotato transcriptome and haplotype-resolved genome. The two methodologies exhibited differences in the number and class of the unique proteins extracted. Overall, 39,916 peptides mapped to 3,143 unique proteins in leaves, and 34,339 peptides mapped to 2,928 unique proteins in roots. Primary metabolism and protein translation processes were enriched in leaves, whereas genetic pathways associated with protein folding, transport, sorting, as well as pathways in the primary carbohydrate metabolism were enriched in storage roots. A proteogenomics analysis successfully mapped 90.4\% of the total uniquely identified peptides against the sweetpotato transcriptome and genome, predicted 741 new protein-coding genes, and specified 2056 loci where gene annotations can be further improved. The proteogenomics results provide evidence for the translation of new open reading frames (ORFs), alternative ORFs, exon extensions, and intronic ORF sequences.

	abstract = {Sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] is an important food security crop for many rural households in Africa, largely providing calories, together with some protein, minerals and vitamins. In Africa, sweetpotato yields range from 3-6 tons ha -1 relative to a maximum achievable yield of 40-50 tons ha -1 , due to biotic and abiotic stresses, and to socio-economic constraints affecting agricultural inputs. Genetic improvement of the crop is essential to boost productivity. However, the inherent nature of sweetpotato including self- and cross-incompatibility, polyploidy, heterozygosity and a large chromosome number (2n=6x=90) complicate its genetic improvement. In the breeding of the crop, self- and cross-incompatibilities limit combining of desirable traits from candidate parents if they belong to the same incompatibility group. The objectives of this review are three-fold. The first section focuses on highlighting the effects of incompatibility on sweetpotato breeding. The second part focuses on describing the types of incompatibilities and methods to determine and distinguish between incompatibility and sterility. The third part of the review examines techniques that can be used to overcome incompatibilities. The information outlined in the review may assist sweetpotato breeders to manage the detrimental effects of incompatibilities, and for the strategic genetic conservation of the crop.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          The ability to generate long reads on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies sequencing platform is dependent on the isolation of high molecular weight DNA free of impurities. For some taxa, this is relatively straightforward; however, for plants, the presence of cell walls and a diverse set of specialized metabolites such as lignin, phenolics, alkaloids, terpenes, and flavonoids present significant challenges in the generation of DNA suitable for production of long reads. Success in generating long read lengths and genome assemblies of plants has been reported using diverse DNA isolation methods, some of which were tailored to the target species and/or required extensive labor. To avoid the need to optimize DNA isolation for each species, we developed a taxa-independent DNA isolation method that is relatively simple and efficient. This method expands on the Oxford Nanopore Technologies high molecular weight genomic DNA protocol from plant leaves and utilizes a conventional cetyl trimethylammonium bromide extraction followed by removal of impurities and short DNA fragments using commercially available kits that yielded robust N50 read lengths and yield on Oxford Nanopore Technologies flow cells.},

	abstract = {Stylisma (Convolvulaceae) is a small genus of dawnflowers found in the sandhills of southeastern United States. The genus is in need of a taxonomic revision because the last revision was long ago, it did not appropriately resolve the relationships within the genus, and there are several threatened or endangered taxa in the genus. A phylogenetic study of the genus is presented here, using two chloroplast markers, the trnT-L intergeneric spacer and the rps16 intron. A phenetic study of the genus is also presented examining 40 characters in 430 specimens and analyzing the resulting matrix with ordination (PCA) methods. Both data sets result in three clades of similar topology. The molecular data combines Stylisma patens and Stylisma humistrata into a single clade, Stylisma pickeringii into a monospecific clade, and Stylisma villosa, Stylisma abdita, and Stylisma aquatica into a separate clade. The morphological data agree with the molecular data as to the placement of S. pickeringii into its own clade, but separates S. abdita into a second clade and lumps the remainder of the genus into a third clade. The combined morphological and molecular results suggest Stylisma to be a complex group that requires more work to determine the spurious species boundaries.},

	abstract = {Parallelism is defined in this study as homologous traits within a family. Convergence occurs when different families have the same characteristics. To study the influence of these phenomena on phylogeny, an analysis was made of the Convolvulaceae using all 55 genera, plus major subdivisions of Ipomoea and Merremia. Traits were used for life form, longevity, roots, stems, leaves, inflorescences, flowers, pollen, fruits, seeds, embryos, cotyledons and chromosome numbers. Of 128 characteristics, 104 (80.7\%) show parallelisms. Of these 104 parallelisms, 61 (47.7\%) are also convergences with one or more outgroups. Three stages in the plant life-cycle are identified as driving parallel traits: vegetative, reproductive and dispersal. Reproduction is most important, selecting 66 traits; the other two are equally significant, driving 27 (environment) and 28 (dispersal) traits. Forces driving the remaining seven of the 128 traits are unknown. Current literature provides a theoretical and experimental context for the selective forces on the individual traits.},

	abstract = {Relaxed clock methods account for among-branch-rate-variation when estimating divergence times by inferring different rates for individual branches. In order to infer different rates for individual branches, important assumptions are required. This is because molecular sequence data does not provide direct information about rates, but instead provides direct information about the total number of substitutions along any branch, which is a product of the rate and time for that branch. Often, the assumptions required for estimating rates for individual branches depend heavily on the implementation of multiple fossil calibrations in a single phylogeny. Here, we show that the basis of these assumptions is often critically undermined. First, we highlight that the temporal distribution of the fossil record often violates key assumptions of methods that use multiple fossil calibrations with relaxed clocks. With respect to “node calibration” methods, this conclusion is based on our inference that different fossil calibrations are unlikely to reflect the relative ages of different clades. With respect to the fossilised-birth-death-process, this conclusion is based on our inference that the fossil recovery rate is often highly heterogeneous. We then demonstrate that methods of divergence time estimation that use multiple fossil calibrations are highly sensitive to assumptions about the fossil record and among-branch-rate-variation. Given the problems associated with these assumptions, our results highlight that using multiple fossil calibrations with relaxed clocks often does little to improve the accuracy of divergence time estimates.},

Nearly all animal mitochondrial genomes are about 16.5. kbp in length, whereas plant mitochondrial genomes range between 200-2,000 kbp. This is curious if we assume modern mitochondria originated from a common alpha-proteobacterial ancestor. Despite their size, plant mitochondrial genomes do not contain significantly more genes than their animal counterparts. Most of the additional DNA found in plant mitochondrial genomes consists of large introns, repeats and non-coding regions. Furthermore, plant mtDNA does not exist as large circular DNA molecules but mostly as a collection of linear DNA with combinations of smaller circular and branched molecules. Studies into these highly fragmented genomes heavily imply that recombination is the main mechanism driving replication of plant mtDNA},

	abstract = {Chloroplast DNA restriction site variation was studied in 31 New World species of Ipomoea, representing a majority of the New World sections and series within the genus. Using 14 endonucleases, a total of 124 phylogenetically informative restriction sites was detected. Dollo parsimony, Wagner parsimony, and bootstrap methods were employed to construct phylogenetic trees and evaluate confidence intervals of monophyletic groups. With a few exceptions, groups circumscribed on the basis of morphological variation are in agreement with groupings based on restriction site variation. Relationships between subgeneric groupings, however, disagree substantially with those proposed in the past. Although conflicting hypotheses for some intersectional relationships are not presently resolvable, cpDNA restriction site analyses propose the following refinements of existing classification schemes. Ipomoea ser. Setosae is divided into distantly related groups, as is sect.Pharbitis. Series Tyrianthinae, a proposed segregate of sect. Pharbitis, is associated with sect. Calonyction and the Tricolor complex (subg. Quamoclit). Ipomoea sect. Batatas is segregated from other herbaceous groups of the heterogeneous subg. Quamoclit sensu lato and aligned as a derivative of I. setosa, subg. Eriospermum. To test for homology of key characters weighted in traditional schemes, morphological features were studied with respect to their distribution on lineages defined by restriction site data. Characters such as setose sepals, foliose-pubescent sepals, and erect growth habit, among others, are interpreted as having multiple origins, while 3-locular ovaries, 4-locular ovaries, and long-haired seeds have evolved only once.},

These woods were obtained from the uplandpine-oak savanna, the tropical deciduous forest of the Comayagua Valley, and the circum-riverine community along the HumuyaRiver. In an unusual discovery, the wood of cashew (Anacardium cf. occidentale) was found in Middle Formative contexts.

	abstract = {A key feature of life’s diversity is that some species are common but many more are rare. Nonetheless, at global scales, we do not know what fraction of biodiversity consists of rare species. Here, we present the largest compilation of global plant diversity to quantify the fraction of Earth’s plant biodiversity that are rare. A large fraction, {\textasciitilde}36.5\% of Earth’s {\textasciitilde}435,000 plant species, are exceedingly rare. Sampling biases and prominent models, such as neutral theory and the k-niche model, cannot account for the observed prevalence of rarity. Our results indicate that (i) climatically more stable regions have harbored rare species and hence a large fraction of Earth’s plant species via reduced extinction risk but that (ii) climate change and human land use are now disproportionately impacting rare species. Estimates of global species abundance distributions have important implications for risk assessments and conservation planning in this era of rapid global change.},

	abstract = {RAPD (randomly amplified polymorphic DNA) technology was applied to analyze the genetic variability of sweet potato germplasm existing in Chile and elsewhere. Analysis of 28 cultivars from all over the world showed polymorphic bands with all 18 primers tested. A total of 124 RAPD bands were scored with an average of 6.9 polymorphic bands per primer. These results confirm that sweet potato exhibits high genetic variation. Two groups were distinguished: one containing Peruvian cultivars, and another containing cultivars from the rest of the world. Analysis of 14 accessions from Central Chile and one from Northern Chile showed polymorphic bands with 24 of 26 primers tested, but almost all of the 140 polymorphic bands merely showed the distinctness of the Northern accession. The almost complete uniformity of the other 14 accessions shows that sweet potato germplasm collected in Central Chile has very little genetic variability and may be derived from a single cultivar. Based on these results and on historical records, some hypotheses are proposed to explain the origin of sweet potatoes cultivated in Chile.},

	abstract = {The presence of high variability among sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L) Lam.) genotypes for morphological characters, especially shoot tips, used for vegetable is important to plan effective breeding programs. An experiment was carried using selected twenty-two genotypes from germplasm and farmers collections. The objective was to estimate the nature and magnitude of variability among morphology, yield and yield components and organoleptic traits in the sweetpotato. Observations were recorded on twenty-two characters. The analysis of variance revealed that there were highly significant (p{\textbackslash}textless0.01) differences among the genotypes for all the characters. Wide ranges of genotypic variability were observed among the genotypes for most of the characters. In morphological traits, 11.5 to 100\% of the observable variability was due to the genetic variation while in yield and yield components this value ranged from 91.67 to 100\% indicating the existence of immense inherent variability among the genotypes. Meanwhile, in organoleptic traits the value ranged from 19.63 to 29.5\% of the observable variability and was due to higher phenotypic variability than genotypic contribution suggesting that the role played by the testing panels in expressing their scores on palatability vary greatly. High genotypic coefficients of variation along with high heritability were recorded for petiole length and leaf area in 10 cm tip in morphological characters, whereas, in yield and yield components the traits were total shoot and root yield and in organoleptic traits it was tenderness. Thus, future improvement of the genotypes could exploit the genetic variability available in these germplasm collections.},

            The Sunda-Sahul Convergence Zone, defined here as the area comprising Australia, New Guinea, and Southeast Asia (Indonesia to Myanmar), straddles the Sunda and Sahul continental shelves and is one of the most biogeographically famous and important regions in the world. Floristically, it is thought to harbour a large amount of the world’s diversity. Despite the importance of the area, a checklist of the flora has never before been published. Here we present the first working checklist of vascular plants for the Sunda-Sahul Convergence Zone. The list was compiled from 24 flora volumes, online databases and unpublished plot data. Taxonomic nomenclature was updated, and each species was coded into nested biogeographic regions. The list includes 60,415 species in 5,135 genera and 363 families of vascular plants.
            
              New information
            
            This is the first species-level checklist of the region and presents an updated census of the region’s floristic biodiversity. The checklist confirms that species richness of the SSCZ is comparable to that of the Neotropics, and highlights areas in need of further documentation and taxonomic work. This checklist provides a novel dataset for studying floristic ecology and evolution in this biogeographically important region of very high global biodiversity.},

Of 460 primers, 84 generating 196 well-resolved repeatable markers were selected for genetic analysis. `Vardaman' and `Regal' testcross progenies were analyzed for segregation and linkages of RAPD markers. Type of polyploidy, autopolyploidy, or allopolyploidy is uncertain in sweetpotato and was examined in this study using the ratio of nonsimplex to simplex RAPD markers and the ratio of simplex RAPD marker pairs linked in repulsion to coupling. Both measures indicated autopolyploidy. Low-density RAPD linkage maps of `Vardaman' and `Regal' were constructed from simplex RAPD marker linkage analysis. Duplex and triplex markers were then mapped manually into the simplex marker map. Homologous linkage groups were identified using nonsimplex RAPD markers and three homologous groups were found in each of the parent maps. Use of nonsimplex markers increased mapping efficiency. The `Vardaman' map had a predicted coverage of 10.5\% at a 25-cM interval of the genome size of 5024 cM. In `Regal', genome coverage was estimated to be 5.6\% at a 25-cM interval of the genome size of 6560 cM. Therefore, average chromosome length was ≈56 to 73 cM.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Okinawan sweet potato, Ipomoea batatas, is an important food staple and export crop for the Island of Hawaii. Cylas formicarius elegantulus, sweet potato weevil, is a major quarantine pest that causes severe destruction to the crop. Root malformation and a bitter taste occur when larvae feed and tunnel within the storage root. Off-grade roots are often left in the field after harvest and serve as a reservoir for the weevils. Current management involves the unsustainable practice of moving to virgin land for the next cropping cycle. Strains of Heterorhabditis indica isolated from the Hawaiian Islands were tested for their efficacy at causing mortality of C. formicarius and reducing the emergence of adults from infested roots. In well plate assays, H. indica caused mortality of 88\% larvae, 96\% pupae, and 4\% adults after 48 h. When applied to infested roots, the nematodes caused an average mortality of 78\% larvae, 66\% pupae, and 32\% adults. Greater mortality was observed at the highest inoculum levels (10,000 infective juveniles per storage tuber) but a reduction of 90\% inoculum density was still effective at weevil management. In simulated field trials, infestation of storage roots was reduced by 42–99.6\% when planted among infested roots that had been inoculated with H. indica. Rates of 2.5 billion IJs/hectare were just as effective as 5 billion IJs/hectare. Application of local H. indica strains in sweet potato production has the potential to manage C. formicarius populations and allow for consecutive cropping seasons.},

The wilt incidence in the early stage represented 17.9\%, 5.9\%, and 8.3\% in 2015, 2016, and 2017, respectively. Samples were collected, and the causal organism was isolated on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Ten pure cultures were stored at the Sweetpotato Research Laboratory, Bioenergy Crop Research Institute, Muan, Korea. Morphological analysis, along with molecular phylogeny of the sequences of internal-transcribed spacer (ITS) and elongation factor 1-α (EF-1α) genes and their combined phylogenetic analysis, confirmed the isolates as the Fusarium oxysporum Schltdl. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on sweetpotato stems, and storage roots by artificially inoculation methods, and the most virulent isolate was selected as SPL18019. A rapid screening method on 21 selected varieties for resistant variety selection was applied on stems. The Pungwanmi was found resistant to Fusarium wilt, whereas Annobeni was the most susceptible. On the other hand, six varieties were used to test surface rot resistance, and Yulmi and Yesumi were resistant and susceptible, respectively, to Fusarium surface rot.},

	abstract = {Heteroplasmy occurs when copies of an organellar genome (plastid or mitochondrial) differ from one another either within a cell or among cells within an individual. This phenomenon was first discovered in plastids over 100 years ago, though ‘heteroplasmy’ was not formally defined until decades later. Mitochondrial and plastid heteroplasmy have since been discovered in diverse taxa, including numerous plants, particularly those with the gynodioecious breeding system. Though heteroplasmy can arise through mutations in organellar genomes, biparental inheritance of organelles often generates heteroplasmy. This article is intended to summarise the cytoploid nature of organellar genomes and different aspects of mitochondrial and plastid heteroplasmy, from its discovery, to the development of detection methods. We will also discuss the effects of heteroplasmy on individuals, populations, and species, with regard to fitness, cytonuclear interactions, and genome evolution. Finally, we highlight a few research questions which we consider in need of further investigation to understand the prevalence and effects of heteroplasmy in natural settings.},

Here, we report an example of plastome heteroplasmy and its characteristics in Gentiana tongolensis (Gentianaceae). The plastid genome of G. tongolensis is 145,757 bp in size and is missing parts of petD gene when compared with other Gentiana species. A total of 112 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and 31 indels with frequencies of more than 2\% were detected in the plastid genome, and most were located in protein coding regions. Most sites with SNP frequencies of more than 10\% were located in six genes in the LSC region. After verification via cloning and Sanger sequencing at three loci, heteroplasmy was identified in different individuals. The cause of heteroplasmy at the nucleotide level in plastome of G. tongolensis is unclear from the present data, although biparental plastid inheritance and transfer of plastid DNA seem to be most likely. This study implies that botanists should reconsider the heredity and evolution of chloroplasts and be cautious with using chloroplasts as genetic markers, especially in Gentiana.},

Por ello, en el presente trabajo se planteó el estudio de tres enredaderas nativas de Argentina, Ipomoea cairica, I. purpurea e I. rubriflora, y de I. carnea ssp. fistulosa, árbol con crecimiento{\textless}br /{\textgreater}normal, con el fin de comparar el desarrollo de sus tallos y aportar datos de interés para dilucidar sus relaciones filogenéticas.

Por otro lado, las enredaderas presentaron sólo dos tipos de variante cambial, el patrón lobado y el de cámbium{\textless}br /{\textgreater}supernumerario. Se puede inferir que en Ipomoea el tipo de crecimiento secundario, así como los tipos de variante cambial, no estarían directamente relacionados con el hábito; sin embargo, otras características del leño pueden ponerse a consideración como la proporción de tejido parenquimático y características de los vasos.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This research has been carried out by consulting various archival and bibliographical sources, in addition to fieldwork. The theoretical–methodological approach is based on the proposal of the Brazilian anthropologist Darcy Ribeiro, who, in the typology of the peoples of America, considers the population of the Antilles as New Peoples. There is an enormous quantity of terms of origin aruaco still alive in the speech of the Cuban people. We present the most important terms systematically, by means of a table, divided in elements of material and spiritual culture of the population of this region of Cuba, which give cohesion and meaning to cubanity understood as: the Cuban character, idiosyncrasy, and condition. The Cuban people is rooted en its Creole past, a product of a mixture principally between the Spanish and the Afro, with a fundamental indigenous basis, and in the actual cubanity which is the product of this historical process of integration and synthetization of all the ethno–cultural elements which constitute it as the ethno–cultural identity of the Cuban people.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Clustering homologous sequences based on their similarity is a problem that appears in many bioinformatics applications. The fact that sequences cluster is ultimately the result of their phylogenetic relationships. Despite this observation and the natural ways in which a tree can define clusters, most applications of sequence clustering do not use a phylogenetic tree and instead operate on pairwise sequence distances. Due to advances in large-scale phylogenetic inference, we argue that tree-based clustering is under-utilized. We define a family of optimization problems that, given a (not necessarily ultrametric) tree, return the minimum number of clusters such that all clusters adhere to constraints on their heterogeneity. We study three specific constraints that limit the diameter of each cluster, the sum of its branch lengths, or chains of pairwise distances. These three versions of the problem can be solved in time that increases linearly with the size of the tree, a fact that has been known by computer scientists for two of these three criteria for decades. We implement these algorithms in a tool called TreeCluster, which we test on three applications: OTU picking for microbiome data, HIV transmission clustering, and divide-and-conquer multiple sequence alignment. We show that, by using tree-based distances, TreeCluster generates more internally consistent clusters than alternatives and improves the effectiveness of downstream applications. TreeCluster is available at

	abstract = {Polynesians introduced the tropical crop taro (
              Colocasia esculenta
              ) to temperate New Zealand after 1280 CE, but evidence for its cultivation is limited. This contrasts with the abundant evidence for big game hunting, raising longstanding questions of the initial economic and ecological importance of crop production. Here we compare fossil data from wetland sedimentary deposits indicative of taro and leaf vegetable (including
              Sonchus
              and
              Rorippa
              spp.) cultivation from Ahuahu, a northern New Zealand offshore island, with Raivavae and Rapa, both subtropical islands in French Polynesia. Preservation of taro pollen on all islands between 1300 CE and 1550 CE indicates perennial cultivation over multiple growing seasons, as plants rarely flower when frequently harvested. The pollen cooccurs with previously undetected fossil remains of extinct trees, as well as many weeds and commensal invertebrates common to tropical Polynesian gardens. Sedimentary charcoal and charred plant remains show that fire use rapidly reduced forest cover, particularly on Ahuahu. Fires were less frequent by 1500 CE on all islands as forest cover diminished, and short-lived plants increased, indicating higher-intensity production. The northern offshore islands of New Zealand were likely preferred sites for early gardens where taro production was briefly attempted, before being supplanted by sweet potato (
              Ipomoea batatas
              ), a more temperate climate-adapted crop, which was later established in large-scale cultivation systems on the mainland after 1500 CE.},

This information is vital for interpreting the archaeological record not just in the study area, but also in all those parts of West Mexico and elsewhere in Mesoamerica where lakes, rivers, marshes, and streams offered a natural bounty for human exploitation. The Lake Cuitzeo Basin was a key economic area for the prehispanic Tarascan state, thanks to its wealth of mineral resources (primarily obsidian and salt). Although non-agricultural resources such as fish, wild plants, aquatic fowl and other wildlife were probably no less important for human subsistence than the area’s mineral riches, they have seldom been taken systematically into consideration by archaeologists in this part of Mesoamerica. This ethnoarchaeological research sheds light on ancient subsistence through the study of contemporary activities such as fishing, hunting, and gathering wild plants, and the associated material culture and work areas. This ethnographic information, as well as the extant ethnohistorical and archaeological records, offer an insight into prehispanic subsistence activities, which is critical for a better understanding of cultural and ecological adaptation in the study area through time.},

Jacq.] and entireleaf morningglory [I. hederacea (L.) Jacq. var. integriuscula Gray]. Controlled matings were made between pure breeding forms of plants with these two leaf types. The first generation progeny (F1) were all ivyleaf and the second generation (F2) was segregated in a 3:1 ratio (ivyleaf to entireleaf). The data fit a single gene model for determination of leaf shape, with ivyleaf being the dominant allele. Despite the dominance of the ivyleaf trait, the abundance of the entireleaf phenotype in the Mississippi Delta was higher than that of ivyleaf. Ipomoea hederacea is a facultative self-pollinator and other annual morningglory species found in the same area are also self-pollinated.},

The test requires data from an interspecific comparison of at least two regions of the genome and data on levels of intraspecific polymorphism in the same regions from at least one species. The model is rejected for data from the region encompassing the Adh locus and the 5' flanking sequence of Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila sechellia. The data depart from the model in a direction that is consistent with the presence of balanced polymorphism in the coding region.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.), a hexaploid outcrossing crop, is an important staple and food security crop in developing countries in Africa and Asia. The availability of genomic resources for sweetpotato is in striking contrast to its importance for human nutrition. Previously existing sequence data were restricted to around 22,000 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences and {\textbackslash}textasciitilde 1,500 GenBank sequences. We have used 454 pyrosequencing to augment the available gene sequence information to enhance functional genomics and marker design for this plant species. RESULTS Two quarter 454 pyrosequencing runs used two normalized cDNA collections from stems and leaves from drought-stressed sweetpotato clone Tanzania and yielded 524,209 reads, which were assembled together with 22,094 publically available expressed sequence tags into 31,685 sets of overlapping DNA segments and 34,733 unassembled sequences. Blastx comparisons with the UniRef100 database allowed annotation of 23,957 contigs and 15,342 singletons resulting in 24,657 putatively unique genes. Further, 27,119 sequences had no match to protein sequences of UniRef100database. On the basis of this gene index, we have identified 1,661 gene-based microsatellite sequences, of which 223 were selected for testing and 195 were successfully amplified in a test panel of 6 hexaploid (I. batatas) and 2 diploid (I. trifida) accessions. CONCLUSIONS The sweetpotato gene index is a useful source for functionally annotated sweetpotato gene sequences that contains three times more gene sequence information for sweetpotato than previous EST assemblies. A searchable version of the gene index, including a blastn function, is available at http://www.cipotato.org/sweetpotato\_gene\_index.},

	url = {https://herbaria.plants.ox.ac.uk/bol/Content/Projects/oxford/resources/Rapid_Botanic_Survey_manual_2016.pdf},
	abstract = {Rapid Botanic Survey (RBS) is primarily a field survey methodology for assessing species-rich plant communities, but it is associated with a range of non-field activities, analyses and outputs that can be considered part of RBS in a broad sense. This document is about the full range of typical RBS activities, from field to herbarium to database to output.RBS outputs are used for mappingvegetation andprioritisingareas for different management purposes, including conservation. RBS activities integrate species and community level assessments. RBS is particularly appropriate in species-rich, incompletely exploredvegetation, but could be used in any plant community. RBS data are used to determine the main patterns of floristic variation in plant communities across a landscape.RBS is also used,even in well-known vegetation,for measuring bioquality ‘temperature’:the degree to which a sample is a biodiversity hotspot. RBS can be applied at any scale; it has been used to plan national and regional conservation strategies, as well as local Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs).RBS builds on a foundation of herbariumdataand provides a generally more complete and less biased picture of plant biogeographic and ecological patternsthan is available from herbaria alone. A typical survey involves databasing some existing herbarium and published dataof various types, and enumeration of a suite of new RBS-specific samplesin the field. The new samplesfill the often substantial gaps in knowledge about plant distribution and provide data on a cross-section of habitats in a defined survey area, using a standardised approach.The field surveytells us where each plant species liveswithin sampled landscapes. The backgroundresearch meanwhile leads to the categorisation, into ‘Stars’, of the global rarity of each speciesas a basis for highlighting the global significance of local populations and vegetation patches. Plant communities, even local associations of species occupying a few square metres, are scored or evaluated based on the species found there and other local information collected during the surveys. The way in which Star ratings feed into community level “bioquality” valuationsis described on p. 9. Whilst biodiversity hotspots have been crudely and ambiguously defined on the broad global scale, RBS aims to achieve greater precision, higher resolution, practicality and transparency in biodiversity hotspot research. Globalplant biodiversity is being eroded daily, and ideal solutions to its conservation are not going to be possible soon enough in many areas.One of the premises of RBS is that it is essential to make the most of what can be assessed  with  limited  resources,  rather  than  waiting  for  perfect  answers.  RBSpromotessuccessiveapproximation and encourages fuzzy logic,when crisp logic and detailed studies would not lead anywhere fast enough. The RBS framework provides objective, transparent and repeatable, best-available answers that areopen to refinement if time allows. This is one of the key differences between RBS and various other, ‘Ivory Tower’ approaches to biodiversity evaluation. Whilst the bull-dozers push back nature throughout the world,RBS places pragmatism before academic purity in a bid to do somethingbefore the subject matter disappears. It is possible to define and use Star ratings and measure bioquality without RBS samples; and to make good useof RBS sample data without defining Stars. If you are interested in using RBS for purposes other than bioquality evaluation, skip to page 7.RBS-derived data form a good foundation for studies in many related disciplines, for example the impacts of development or climate change on biodiversity, orstudies of possible or actual impacts on species distribution.},

Different varieties gain different phenolic profiles which has drawn researchers’ attention for its unique health benefits. Our study evaluated the phenolic profiles, total and cellular antioxidant activities, antiproliferative activities, and cytotoxicity in 10 cultivated varieties of sweet potato in different colours. Among fourteen metabolites detected in our study, hyperoside, ferulic acid and caffeic acid were considered as prominent in SPSRs. According to the principle component analysis, phytochemical composition of HX22, YS15 and YS7 was quite similar. The results also evidenced that purple-fleshed varieties, such as YS43, YZ7 and YY153, have higher total phenolics content and corresponding stronger total antioxidant capacities as well as cellular antiproliferative activities against human liver cancer HepG2 cells than other varieties. The extremely significant correlation between phenolics and total antioxidant activity was also revealed by Pearson correlation analysis (p {\textless} 0.05). However, no significant relevance was found between intracellular antioxidant activity and total phenolic content or flesh colour of sweet potatoes.},

	abstract = {Background and aims – We revisited Florula Lagoensis, the first floristic list of the Cerrado, published in 1892 by Eugen Warming. All flowering plants were nomenclaturally and taxonomically updated and associated with type material collected by him. We also analysed the contribution of new collections made in Lagoa Santa to assess how many species were recollected after his work. Methods – We have used the list of phanerogams in Warming’s 1908 translation as primary data source and we performed a search on Brazilian virtual herbaria to retrieve all material collected at the locality of Lagoa Santa and surroundings. Key results – Out of 2270 species collected by Warming, 560 (24.7\%) have been recollected after 150 years, and only 242 species (9.6\%) were new additions to the list. A total of 381 (14.4\%) specific or infra-specific names from Florula Lagoensis have type specimens collected by Warming. Conclusions – It is fair to recognize Eugen Warming as one of the pioneers of floristic studies in Brazil. We stress the completeness of his work and highlight the importance of following Warming’s footsteps, collecting intensively, exploring different environments, and working in a collaborative way.},

In Brazil, 24 genera and 403 species are found in all phytogeographic domains. The Sete Cidades National Park is located in the northeastern region, Piauí State, at an ecotone between Cerrado and Caatinga. Despite the abundance of Convolvulaceae in these environments and the biodiversity potential of Piauí State, there are no floristic studies about this family published for the State. This project aimed to inventory Convolvulaceae in the PARNA Sete Cidades. For this purpose, we visited the Herbarium Graziela Barroso (TEPB) collection and also made a field expedition. The species collected were identified based on the specialized bibliography and the voucher material was deposited in the Herbarium Professor Vasconcelos Sobrinho (PEUFR). Representatives of five genera were found: Cuscuta, Daustinia, Evolvulus, Ipomoea and Jacquemontia, totaling eight species.},

	abstract = {Hawai`i's ranching community grew out of indigenous attempts to manage European livestock introduced by explorers and merchants in the late 1700s. During the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the ranch workforce became increasingly multiethnic with the inclusion of Asian contract laborers and their descendants. This dissertation examines the origins and development of the ranching community to understand the underlying social forces that encouraged the incorporation of immigrants into its ranks. Hawai`i has long been considered a "social laboratory" for studying interethnic relations, and models of assimilation, acculturation, and creolization have been used to describe its multicultural population, but these models inadequately characterize and explain Hawai`i's ranching community. Rather than apply these models uncritically to describe the community's ethnogenesis, this dissertation proposes that a metaphor derived from the Hawaiian concept of pili, roughly "connection" in English, provides a contextualized explanatory framework appropriate to its Hawaiian linguistic, geographic, and cultural origins. Pili describes the ethnogenesis of the ranching community as the formation and reinforcement of kin- and kin-like connections among existing community members and newcomers. Using documentary and archaeological evidence of a century of ranching at Laumai`a on Hawai`i Island, I frame this process as one informed by tensions between two modes of capitalism used on the ranch: on the one hand, an indigenized capitalism that included Hawaiian genealogical and social connections in its management strategies, and on the other, an EuroAmerican form that emphasized profit and efficiency over human connection. These strategies structured the negotiations of identity among ranch workers that transformed transnationals into community members who contributed to a hybrid culture that, paradoxically, remains uniquely Hawaiian.},

	url = {https://search.proquest.com/docview/2405597806/abstract/1C1B3C03363E408BPQ},
	abstract = {The sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas Lam.) and the potato (Solanum tuberosum subsp. tuberosum L.) have longstanding histories as staple crops, have undergone thousands of years of domestication and cultivation, provide high caloric yield per acre, are dense with essential nutrients, and they are both asexually propagated complex polyploids. Although they have many small differences, both crops serve similar purposes, and from a breeding perspective, similar breeding strategies are used for crop improvement. The studies of the genetic diversity of the sweetpotato breeding germplasm maintained at NCSU and the inheritance of the nutritional anthocyanin pigments produced in a biparental potato mapping population reported herein, were conducted to: 1) increase our understanding of genetic diversity present in the NC State sweetpotato breeding program so that the program can more efficiently harness the diversity to create new varieties; and 2) identify quantitative trait loci (QTL) for anthocyanin production in potato that can be used for marker-assisted breeding of purple-fleshed potatoes for the specialty potato market sector.

Maintaining and understanding germplasm diversity is crucial for breeding programs. Sweetpotato is a staple food source for global communities and its complex genetics pose steep challenges for elite cultivar development. We compared simple sequence repeat (SSR) and single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of each marker system for assessing genetic relationships amongst sweetpotato germplasm from different growing regions and breeding programs. Structure cluster analysis, comparison of genetic distance matrices and phylogenetic trees, and principal component analysis were used to assess the population structure predicted by the marker systems. We observed that the 1,312 SNP markers, developed in this study were denser and more evenly distributed throughout the genome, and they characterized the germplasm more effectively compared to the 100 polymorphic bands of the 11 SSR markers. The SSR markers established a population structure of 2 major clades divided into 7 clusters. The SNP markers established a population structure of 3 major clades divided into 8 clusters, with some clones showing genetic admixture.

Demand for anthocyanin-rich foods has increased over the past few decades following the increase in literature surrounding the possible health benefits of their antioxidant functionality. With potato being such an important staple crop, breeding for higher anthocyanin content could be a rapid way to include more nutrition in areas that have poor diets. Electrospray ionization-Time of flight/Mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF/MS) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) were utilized to characterize, identify, and quantify 19 constituent anthocyanin pigments and total monomeric anthocyanin (TMA) concentration in a biparental genetic mapping population in potato, segregating for anthocyanin accumulation. Linkage analysis of SNP markers derived from an Illumina Infinium 8303 Potato Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) Array was used to build a 1056 cM genetic map of the cross with 12 homologous linkage groups (LG). A total of 36 quantitative trait loci (QTL) were identified for 18 traits associated with anthocyanin and anthocyanidin production in potato. Two QTL were associated with transcript regions that contain key hydroxylase enzymes for the biosynthesis of flavonoids. A third of the putative transcript regions correlated with the QTL contain possible transcription factors. Other putative associated regions were related to stress response, noncoding regions, protein modification enzymes, and sucrose phosphorylation and dephosphorylation enzymes.},

Recent advances in polyploid quantitative genetics and bioinformatics have facilitated entry into a new era where quantitative trait loci (QTL) and candidate genes for specific traits in polyploid crops such as sweetpotato are becoming more feasible. These new tools have become critical components for advancing cultivar development by helping us to understand the genetic factors underlying both simple and complex traits in sweetpotato. In this study, a biparental mapping population (DC) was created by crossing the light yellow-fleshed, high dry matter breeding line NCDM04-0001 (female) with the orange-fleshed, low dry matter cultivar Covington (male). Genotyping by sequencing (GBS), via a modified protocol called GBSpoly, was used to identify high-quality single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the DC population from Illumina sequence data. The SNPs were analyzed utilizing novel genetic linkage mapping and QTL analysis algorithms (MAPpoly and QTLpoly respectively) for complex polyploids to develop a highdensity phased and integrated genetic linkage map of the DC population made up of 15 linkage groups that was phenotyped for important sweetpotato traits including the disease Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. batatas (Fob), and the storage root quality traits β-carotene, sucrose, glucose, and fructose.

Analyses of the mapping population revealed two significant QTL for Fob on linkage groups 10 and 3, responsible for {\textasciitilde}34\% and {\textasciitilde}10\% of total phenotypic variation within the progeny. Based on the combined molecular and phenotypic data it is hypothesized that resistance to Fob is a polygenic trait in sweetpotato, a finding common in plant disease resistance studies.

For β-carotene, sucrose, and fructose we identified three QTL each on linkage groups 2, 3, and 12: 1) On linkage groups 3, 4, and 12 for β-carotene; 2) On linkage groups 1 and 3 (two QTL) for sucrose; and 3) On linkage groups 1 and 3 for fructose. For glucose four QTL were identified on linkage groups 1, 3 (two QTL), and 12. In total, these linkage groups accounted for 82.1\% (β- carotene), 69.2\% (fructose), 71.8\% (sucrose), and 71.0\% (glucose) of total phenotypic variation. Simultaneously, we attempted to ascertain candidate genes responsible for these four traits utilizing recently developed reference genomes of sweetpotato relatives Ipomoea trifida and I. triloba. Using this information, we hope to develop methods for genomic-assisted breeding in the sweetpotato breeding program.},

	abstract = {Experiments were conducted in the laboratory and screenhouse to determine the effects of scarification; alternating day/night temperatures; light, salt, and water stress; seed burial depth; and rice residue on seed germination and seedling emergence of threelobe morningglory, and to evaluate the response of this weed to commonly available POST herbicides in the Philippines. Germination was stimulated by seed scarification, suggesting that inhibition of germination in this species is mainly due to the hard seed coat. Germination of the scarified seeds was not influenced by the tested temperatures (alternating day/night temperatures of 25/15, 30/20, and 35/25 C) and light. The concentrations of sodium chloride, ranging from 0 to 250 mM, did not influence germination of the scarified seeds of threelobe morningglory. The osmotic potential required for 50\% inhibition of maximum germination was −0.35 MPa, although some seeds germinated at −0.6 MPa. Seedling emergence was greatest for the seeds placed on the soil surface (96\%), and emergence declined with increased burial depth in soil. The burial depth required for 50\% inhibition of maximum emergence was 2.8 cm. No seedlings emerged from a burial depth of 6 cm or greater. Residues of up to 6 Mg ha
              −1
              on the soil surface did not influence seedling emergence of threelobe morningglory. The herbicide 2,4-D at 400 g ai ha
              −1
              provided excellent control of threelobe morningglory when applied at the four-leaf (100\%) and six-leaf (97\%) stages. However, at the eight-leaf stage, percent control was reduced to 67\% and herbicide rate had to be increased twofold to achieve 95\% control. The information gained from this study could contribute to developing components of integrated weed management strategies for threelobe morningglory. Soil inversion by tillage to bury weed seeds below their maximum depth of emergence and early application of an effective POST herbicide could serve as important tools for managing threelobe morningglory.},

	doi = {10/gmvm8p},
	abstract = {Sweetpotato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.) is one of the most important crops from the family of Convolvulaceae. It is widely reported that cultivated sweetpotato was originated from Ipomoea trifida. However, diploid, tetraploid and hexaploid I. trifida were found in nature. The relationship, between them, and among them and sweetpotato, is remaining unclear. In the present study, we detected the genome diversity and relationship of sweetpotato and different polyploidy types I. trifida using Restriction-site Associated DNA Sequencing (RAD-seq). A total of 38,605 RAD-tags containing 832,204 SNPs had been identified. These tags were annotated using five public databases, about 11,519 tags were aligned to functional genes in various pathways. Based on SNP genotype, phylogenetic relation analysis results confirmed that cultivated sweetpotato has a closer relationship with I. trifida 6× than with I. trifida 4X and I. trifida 2×. Besides, 5042 SSRs were detected in I. trifida 6×, and 3202 pairs of high-quality SSR primers were developed. A total of 68 primers were randomly selected and synthesized, of which 61 were successfully amplified. These results provided new evidence that cultivated sweetpotato originated from I. trifida 6×, and that I. trifida 6× evolved from I. trifida 4X and I. trifida 2×. Therefore, using I. trifida 6× as the model plant of sweetpotato research should be more practical than using I. trifida 2× in the future. Meanwhile, sequence information and markers from the present study will be helpful for sweetpotato and I. trifida studies in the future.},

Tuber setting of interspecific hybrid changed with different combinations. The tuber setting and fresh root yield of progenies of interspecific hybrid between hexaploid I. trifida and sweetpotato were higher than that of interspecific hybrid between I. trifida (2X, 4X) and sweetpotato. A wide variation of root yield of the interspecific hybrids appeared from the crosses between sweetpotato and wild species. Some superlines had been selected from the cross combinations of sweetpotato with relative wild species.

	abstract = {Reconstructing phylogenies from intraspecific data (such as human mitochondrial DNA variation) is often a challenging task because of large sample sizes and small genetic distances between individuals. The resulting multitude of plausible trees is best expressed by a network which displays alternative potential evolutionary paths in the form of cycles. We present a method ("median joining" [MJ]) for constructing networks from recombination-free population data that combines features of Kruskal's algorithm for finding minimum spanning trees by favoring short connections, and Farris's maximum-parsimony (MP) heuristic algorithm, which sequentially adds new vertices called "median vectors", except that our MJ method does not resolve ties. The MJ method is hence closely related to the earlier approach of Foulds, Hendy, and Penny for estimating MP trees but can be adjusted to the level of homoplasy by setting a parameter epsilon. Unlike our earlier reduced median (RM) network method, MJ is applicable to multistate characters (e.g., amino acid sequences). An additional feature is the speed of the implemented algorithm: a sample of 800 worldwide mtDNA hypervariable segment I sequences requires less than 3 h on a Pentium 120 PC. The MJ method is demonstrated on a Tibetan mitochondrial DNA RFLP data set.},

              Background
              SAMtools and BCFtools are widely used programs for processing and analysing high-throughput sequencing data. They include tools for file format conversion and manipulation, sorting, querying, statistics, variant calling, and effect analysis amongst other methods.
            
            
              Findings
              The first version appeared online 12 years ago and has been maintained and further developed ever since, with many new features and improvements added over the years. The SAMtools and BCFtools packages represent a unique collection of tools that have been used in numerous other software projects and countless genomic pipelines.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Both SAMtools and BCFtools are freely available on GitHub under the permissive MIT licence, free for both non-commercial and commercial use. Both packages have been installed \&gt;1 million times via Bioconda. The source code and documentation are available from https://www.htslib.org.},

High heritability with high GAM was recorded for vine length, leaf area index, number of tubers per vine, total soluble solids, tuber length, tuber yield per plot and tuber yield per hectare which indicates the presence of additive gene effects for these traits. Hence improvement can be done through phenotypic selection. High heritability with low to moderate GAM was observed for inter nodal length, number of auxiliary branches and tuber girth which indicates the role of non additive gene effects. Hence, improvement in these traits would be more effective by selecting specific combinations followed by intense matting of lines.},

	abstract = {In Gainesville, Florida, the coastal morning glory Ipomoea trichocarpa varies considerably in flower size, shape, and stigma-anther separation. I studied some of the causes and reproductive consequences of this variation by exploring its effect on pollen receipt and removal. Variation in flower size was caused by variation within genets and, more drastically, by temperature fluctuations. While several insect taxa visited I. trichocarpa flowers, I concentrated on one hawk moth species (Enyo lugubris) and the bumble bee Bombus pennsylvanicus. Hawk moths visited the flowers from the time of anthesis until sunrise, when bumble bees arrived. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that flower morphology affected pollen deposition during single hawk moth visits, single bumble bee visits, or unlimited hawk moth and bumble bee visits. The morphological variables with strongest effects differed in each case, and could be related to the foraging technique of each pollinator. Floral morphology affected pollen removal from flowers more than it influenced pollen receipt. The morphological variables that best explained variation in the amount of pollen removed from the anthers during a single bumble bee visit differed from those influencing pollen receipt. In the field, hawk moths could potentially fully pollinate I. trichocarpa before pollen from later rising bumble bees could send tubes to ovules. However, tube growth rate increased with rising morning temperatures. Thus, ovules could potentially have been fertilized by a mixture of pollen deposited by hawk moths and by bumble bees. Furthermore, low morning temperatures excluded hawk moths entirely from I. trichocarpa pollination, by delaying anthesis. On cool mornings, flowers opened in time to receive bumble bee visits only. The effect of temperature on flower size and pollinator type, coupled with the physical interaction between flower and pollinator morphologies, determined the amount of pollen removed from and received by I. trichocarpa.},

	abstract = {Sweet potato virus disease (SPVD) is the most devastating viral disease in sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.), causing substantial yield losses worldwide. We conducted a systemic investigation on the spread, transmission, and pathogenesis of SPVD. Field experiments conducted over two years on ten sweet potato varieties showed that SPVD symptoms first occurred in newly developed top leaves, and spread from adjacent to distant plants in the field. The SPVD incidence was mainly (but not only) determined by the resistance of the varieties planted, and each variety exhibited a characteristic subset of SPVD symptoms. SPVD was not robustly transmitted through friction inoculation, but friction of the main stem might contribute to a higher SPVD incidence rate compared to friction of the leaf and branch tissues. Furthermore, our results suggested that SPVD might be latent in the storage root. Therefore, using virus-free storage roots and cuttings, purposeful monitoring for SPVD according to variety-specific symptoms, and swiftly removing infected plants (especially during the later growth stages) would help control and prevent SPVD during sweet potato production. Comparative transcriptome analysis revealed that numerous genes involved in photosynthesis, starch and sucrose metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis, and carotenoid biosynthesis were downregulated following SPVD, whereas those involved in monolignol biosynthesis, zeatin biosynthesis, trehalose metabolism, and linoleic acid metabolism were upregulated. Notably, critical genes involved in pathogenesis and plant defense were significantly induced or suppressed following SPVD. These data provide insights into the molecular changes of sweet potato in response to SPVD and elucidate potential SPVD pathogenesis and defense mechanisms in sweet potato. Our study provides important information that can be used to tailor sustainable SPVD control strategies and guide the molecular breeding of SPVD-resistant sweet potato varieties.},

	abstract = {WRKYs play important roles in plant growth, defense regulation, and stress response. However, the mechanisms through which WRKYs are involved in drought and salt tolerance have been rarely characterized in sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.]. In this study, we cloned a WRKY gene, IbWRKY2, from sweetpotato and its expression was induced with PEG6000, NaCl, and abscisic acid (ABA). The IbWRKY2 was localized in the nucleus. The full-length protein exhibited transactivation activity, and its active domain was located in the N-terminal region. IbWRKY2-overexpressing Arabidopsis showed enhanced drought and salt tolerance. After drought and salt treatments, the contents of ABA and proline as well as the activity of superoxide dismutase (SOD) were higher in transgenic plants, while the malondialdehyde (MDA) and H2O2 contents were lower. In addition, several genes related to the ABA signaling pathway, proline biosynthesis, and the reactive oxygen species (ROS)-scavenging system, were significantly up-regulated in transgenic lines. These results demonstrate that IbWRKY2 confers drought and salt tolerance in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, IbWRKY2 was able to interact with IbVQ4, and the expression of IbVQ4 was induced by drought and salt treatments. These results provide clues regarding the mechanism by which IbWRKY2 contributes to the regulation of abiotic stress tolerance.},

Recently, it has been reported that I. cairica had successfully invaded mangrove wetlands, indicating its high salt tolerance. Based on previous genetic studies, I. cairica offers a good model for characterizing stress-resistant genes. It has recently been identified that the SRO proteins (SIMILAR TO RCD-ONE) play important roles in a variety of stress and developmental responses. Radical-Induced Cell Death1 (RCD1) was the first identified plant SRO protein from Arabidopsis thaliana. As a typical SRO protein, IcSRO1 had a highly conservative WWE domain, a conserved PARP fold and protein C in the RST function area. The expression of IcSRO1 was induced by salt, drought, and the plant hormone ABA. The transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing IcSRO1 showed higher tolerance against salt and drought stress along with lower accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and superoxide (O2−) than the wild type. The IcSRO1 protein was localized in the nucleus after cultivation in the buffer. Our results indicated it could interact with Arabidopsis SALT OVERLY SENSITIVE 1 (AtSOS1), suggesting IcSRO1 may have similar functions. The pleiotropic effect of IcSRO1 on physiological processes contributes to the improvement of plant tolerance against diverse abiotic stresses, and may be associated with the adaptation of I. cairica to those environments with extreme saline and drought conditions. It therefore provides valuable gene resources for crop breeding enhancement.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based genotyping methods can generate numerous genetic markers in a single experiment and have contributed to plant genetic mapping. However, for high precision genetic analysis, the complicated genetic segregation mode in polyploid organisms requires high-coverage NGS data and elaborate analytical algorithms. In the present study, we propose a simple strategy for the genetic mapping of polyploids using low-coverage NGS data. The validity of the strategy was investigated using simulated data. Previous studies indicated that accurate allele dosage estimation from low-coverage NGS data (read depth {\textless} 40) is difficult. Therefore, we used allele dosage probabilities calculated from read counts in association analyses to detect loci associated with phenotypic variations. The allele dosage probabilities showed significant detection power, although higher allele dosage estimation accuracy resulted in higher detection power. On the contrary, differences in the segregation patterns between the marker and causal genes resulted in a drastic decrease in detection power even if the marker and casual genes were in complete linkage and the allele dosage estimation was accurate. These results indicated that the use of a larger number of markers is advantageous, even if the accuracy of allele dosage estimation is low. Finally, we applied the strategy for the genetic mapping of autohexaploid sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) populations to detect loci associated with agronomic traits. Our strategy could constitute a cost-effective approach for preliminary experiments done performed to large-scale studies.},

Lam.] genotypes from a targeted breeding effort. Three sets of genotypes were evaluated in multi‐environment trials (MET). Twelve sweetpotato varieties were evaluated across nine environments representing the main agro‐ecological zones in Ghana. MET analysis was conducted using a stage‐wise approach with the genotype × environment (G × E) table of means used as a starting point to model the G × E interaction for sweetpotato yield. Emphasis was given to the genetic correlation matrix used in a second‐order factor analytic model that accommodates heterogeneity of genetic variances across environments. A genotype main effect and G × E interaction of storage root yield explained 82\% of the variation in the first principal component, and visualized the genetic variances and discriminating power of each environment and the genetic correlation between the environments. Two mega‐environments, corresponding to northern and southern trial sites, were delineated. Six breeding lines selected from the south and eight breeding lines selected from the north were tested and compared to two common check clones at five locations in Ghana. A Finlay–Wilkinson stability analysis resulted in stable performances within the target mega‐environment from which the genotypes were selected, but predominantly without adaptation to the other region. Our results provide a strong rationale for running separate programs to allow for faster genetic progress in each of these two major West African mega‐environments by selecting for specific and broad adaptation.},

	abstract = {In 1876, Brazilian physical anthropologists De Lacerda and Peixoto published findings of detailed anatomical and osteometric investigation of the new human skull collection of Rio de Janeiro’s Museu Nacional. They argued not only that the Indigenous ‘Botocudo’ in Brazil might be autochthonous to the New World, but also that they shared analogic proximity to other geographically very distant human groups – the New Caledonians and Australians – equally attributed limited cranial capacity and resultant inferior intellect. Described by Blumenbach and Morton, ‘Botocudo’ skulls were highly valued scientific specimens in 19th-century physical anthropology. A recent genomic study has again related ‘the Botocudo’ to Indigenous populations from the other side of the world by identifying ‘Polynesian ancestry’ in two of 14 Botocudo skulls held at the Museu Nacional. This article places the production of scientific knowledge in multidisciplinary, multiregional historical perspectives. We contextualize modern narratives in the biological sciences relating ‘Botocudo’ skulls and other cranial material from lowland South America to Polynesia, Melanesia, and Australia. With disturbing irony, such studies often unthinkingly reinscribe essentialized historic racial categories such as ‘the Botocudos’, ‘the Polynesians’, and ‘the Australo-Melanesians’. We conclude that the fertile alliance of intersecting sciences that is revolutionizing understandings of deep human pasts must be informed by sensitivity to the deep histories of terms, classification schemes, and the disciplines themselves.},

	abstract = {Cuscuta reflexa Roxb. belonging to family Cuscutaceae was explored for its pollen morphology and its pollen characters examined with light and scanning electron microscope were compared with six species belonging to family Convolvulaceae. Pollen samples were collected from Districts; Kotli, Bhimber and Mirpur, Azad Jammu \& Kashmir, Pakistan. Flowers of Cuscuta reflexa Roxb., five species of Ipomoea including Ipomoea carnea Jacq., Ipomoea cairica (L.) Sweet , Ipomoea hederacia Jacq., Ipomoea pes-tigridi sL., Ipomoea eriocarpa R.Br., Ipomoea arachnosperma Welw. and Convolvulus arvensis L. were collected. Pollen shape of these selected species are generally prolate, subprolate, prolate-spheroidal, oblate spheroidal and perpolate. The apertures of the pollens of these taxa were found scabrate, scabrate-perforate, reticulate and echinate-reticulate. Among the examined taxa, C. reflexa Roxb. has smallest size of pollen (2-5 x 2.5-5pm) while the largest pollen (28.5-37.6 x 24.7-28.9pm) belongs to the Ipomoe acarnea. It has been founded that pollen of Cuscuta reflexa Roxb. is prolate in shape and was similar to I. carnea Jacq, I pes-tigridis L, I. eriocarpa R.Br pollens. Hierarchical cluster analysis based on pollens observations grouped I. arachnosperma and Cuscuta refelexa together at maximum similarity 99.86 at a distance level of 0.003. It has been concluded from this study that Cuscuta refelexa pollen are exactly similar to Ipomea arachnosperma on the bases of pollen morphology and exine appearance.},

	abstract = {Small farmers have played an important role in maintaining genetic resources of traditional varieties. Collecting and characterizing germplasm, especially landraces and heirloom varieties, are strategic activities that would create a knowledge base describing the traditional varieties of a given region and reduce the risk of genetic erosion. The objectives of this work were as follows: collect sweet potato roots from rural properties and local markets in Rio de Janeiro State, Brazil; characterize the accessions using RAPD and ISSR molecular markers, comparing the efficiency in discrimination of these two types of molecular markers; and estimate the genetic variability of the population. Fifty-nine samples from rural properties and 19 from local markets were studied. A matrix of binary data was developed to analyze the molecular data using the Jaccard index to estimate genetic differences among accessions, and clusters were made using the UPGMA method. The molecular techniques detected genetic variability among the accessions, with cophenetic correlation coefficients (CCC) of 0.80 for RAPDs and 0.89 for ISSRs. The RAPD and ISSR marker results corresponded well, with a correlation of 0.55. All of the accessions were considered distinct, which demonstrates that traditional farmers maintain sweet potato genotypes that have good genetic diversity.},

It flowers between December to April with the peak blooming period in February. During the peak flowering period, nearly 50–60 flowers/plant bloom every day. Flowers open between 5.30 – 6.30 am and the life span of an individual flower is 24 h. Anther dehisce 8-9 h before anthesis, showing the protandrous nature of the flower and at the time of anthesis, 64±3\% pollen grains were viable. Stigma becomes receptive at the time of anthesis. Nectar is secreted by a hypogynous disc. Flowers are visited by several insects and birds. However, Apis dorsata, Trigona iridipennis, Katydid [Letana species (female)], Nectarinia zeylonica and N. asiatica are the main pollinators and Katydid as a pollinator has been reported for the first time. Pollen grains in spite of landing on the receptive surface of the stigma fail to germinate indicating self-incompatible nature of the plant which remains fruitless. The plants from which the pollen was used for cross pollination seems to be clonal sisters and genetically alike.},

DNA-based markers have been developed to distinguish I. mauritiana from the other Vidari candidates. A putative 600-bp polymorphic sequence, specific to I. mauritiana was identified using randomly amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) technique. Furthermore, sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) primers (IM1F and IM1R) were designed from the unique RAPD amplicon. The SCAR primers produced a specific 323-bp amplicon in authentic I. mauritiana and not in the allied species.},

Levels of nucleotide divergence and morphological differentiation among these taxa support the view that each should be recognized as distinct species. These three species display unique intercontinental disjunction, with one species endemic to Hawaii (Jacquemontia sandwicensis A. Gray.), another restricted to eastern Mexico and the Antilles [Jacquemontia obcordata (Millspaugh) House], and the third confined to East and West Africa (J. ovalifolia). The Caribbean and Hawaiian species are sister taxa and are another example of a biogeographical link between the Caribbean Basin and Polynesia.

	title = {Systematics and plastid genome evolution in the parasitic plant genus \textit{{Cuscuta}} (dodder)},
	url = {https://etda.libraries.psu.edu/catalog/6560},
	abstract = {Parasitism has evolved independently many times within the course of angiosperm evolution. One of the most economically damaging of these parasitic lineages is the genus Cuscuta, which is derived from within the Morning Glory Family (Convolvulaceae). All species of Cuscuta are epiphytic stem parasites that lack roots and expanded leaves at maturity. Their hosts include a wide array of non-grass land plants, and a single Cuscuta individual may parasitize dozens of host species simultaneously. Although almost 200 described species exist, identification and taxonomy are difficult within the genus, as few morphological characteristics exist outside of the inflorescence in these reduced parasites. Although only about 10\% of the genes necessary for photosynthesis are transcribed from the plastid chromosome, analyses of plastid genome structure, gene content, and sequence evolution are an excellent and efficient way to study the changes in photosynthetic ability and organellar function that accompany the transition from autotrophy to heterotrophy in angiosperms. This work presents a useful method for acquiring complete plastid genome sequences from parasitic plants, analyses of full plastid genome sequences from two Cuscuta species and a nonparasitic relative, and a well-resolved and highly-supported phylogeny of Cuscuta using 3 plastid genes (rbcL, rps2, and matK) and the nuclear ribosomal internal transcribed spacer locus. A molecular phylogenetic approach is used to address hypotheses involving taxonomy, biogeography, morphological evolution, photosynthetic ability, and plastid genome evolution within the genus.},

Here, I describe a program, SequenceBouncer, that uses the Shannon entropy values of alignment columns to identify outlier alignment sequences in a manner responsive to overall alignment context.

I discuss the ontological, historical, and contemporary aspects of the case on the basis of ethnographic data I collected and archival research I conducted in Easter Island in the summer of 2013 and January 2014. In the first part, I use a semiotic approach to analyze how various Rapanui performance genres reveal Easter Island to be a landscape alive with emplaced other-than-human persons. In the second part, I examine the mediatization and politi-cal use of a leprosy epidemic from the 1890s to the 1960s in the island by the Chilean nation-state, focusing on how a new apparatus of power made autonomous citizens of Rapanui dividual persons. Meanwhile,  outsiders  restored  the  island’s  archaeological  sites  for  the  development  of  a  tourism  industry, in effect reproducing the Rapanui lifeworld at the same time that the Chilean nation-state destroyed the conditions of this lifeworld as a sacred indigenous place. In the third, final part, I in-quire into how Rapanui people of today unmake what is now an uncanny lifeworld by rekindling, in  performance,  relations  with  abandoned  ancestors.  The  thesis  concludes  with  a  discussion  of  a  collaborative project in 2014-2015 that attempts to regenerate dominated forms and modes of be-ing in Rapa Nui.},

The assessment of tendencies in the distribution and resilience of endangered medicinal species against global change can be an excellent tool to predict and minimize future negative effects, even more so if we consider that these species may be useful to us. Spain is one of the richest countries in plant diversity along the Mediterranean basin, and many representatives of the Spanish flora are medicinal plants. Under scenarios of climate change, the distribution ranges of many of these species are likely to alter. In this paper we used ecological niche modeling to predict future changes in the distribution of 41 medicinal plants included in the 2013 assessment of threatened species in Spain. We generated climate-based niche models for each medicinal species and projected them for each decade from 2010 until 2080. Our results identified and prioritized the most vulnerable species and areas to future predicted changes. These results should be useful for conservation planning and especially for prioritizing areas for protection.},

A comprehensive evaluation of IUCN categories for 7269 Spanish vascular plants (GSPC Target 2), using distribution data and environmental niche models, is presented. A gap analysis to assess the percentage of threatened plants effectively conserved in situ (considering national parks, plant micro-reserves and recovery or conservation plans) was also conducted (Target 7). The result is that only 44.4\% threatened species are subject to an adequate in situ protection. An appropriate management of additional natural protected areas towards the conservation of threatened plants would make Spain meet this threshold, but severe deficiencies should be corrected. The methodology presented here is proposed as a tool to assess the degree of achievement of GSPC targets. This procedure can be quickly implemented and allows an easy evaluation of the progress, as well as the pending tasks in a given period of time.},

	abstract = {Evolutionary relationships among plants have been inferred primarily using chloroplast data. To date, no study has comprehensively examined the plastome for gene tree conflict. Using a broad sampling of angiosperm plastomes, we characterize gene tree conflict among plastid genes at various time scales and explore correlates to conflict (e.g., evolutionary rate, gene length, molecule type). We uncover notable gene tree conflict against a backdrop of largely uninformative genes. We find alignment length and tree length are strong predictors of concordance, and that nucleotides outperform amino acids. Of the most commonly used markers, matK, greatly outperforms rbcL; however, the rarely used gene rpoC2 is the top-performing gene in every analysis. We find that rpoC2 reconstructs angiosperm phylogeny as well as the entire concatenated set of protein-coding chloroplast genes. Our results suggest that longer genes are superior for phylogeny reconstruction. The alleviation of some conflict through the use of nucleotides suggests that stochastic and systematic error is likely the root of most of the observed conflict, but further research on biological conflict within plastome is warranted given documented cases of heteroplasmic recombination. We suggest that researchers should filter genes for topological concordance when performing downstream comparative analyses on phylogenetic data, even when using chloroplast genomes.},

	abstract = {Comparisons between insular and continental radiations have been hindered by a lack of reliable estimates of absolute diversification rates in island lineages. We took advantage of rate-constant rDNA sequence evolution and an “external” calibration using paleoclimatic and fossil data to determine the maximum age and minimum diversification rate of the Hawaiian silversword alliance (Compositae), a textbook example of insular adaptive radiation in plants. Our maximum-age estimate of 5.2 ± 0.8 million years ago for the most recent common ancestor of the silversword alliance is much younger than ages calculated by other means for the Hawaiian drosophilids, lobelioids, and honeycreepers and falls approximately within the history of the modern high islands (≤5.1 ± 0.2 million years ago). By using a statistically efficient estimator that reduces error variance by incorporating clock-based estimates of divergence times, a minimum diversification rate for the silversword alliance was estimated to be 0.56 ± 0.17 species per million years. This exceeds average rates of more ancient continental radiations and is comparable to peak rates in taxa with sufficiently rich fossil records that changes in diversification rate can be reconstructed.},

One of the most studied and used as a paradigmatic case is the population collapse of the Rapa Nui society. Here, we test different hypotheses about it by developing explicit population dynamic models that integrate feedbacks between climatic, demographic and ecological factors that underpinned the socio-cultural trajectory of these people. We evaluate our model outputs against a reconstruction of past population size based on archaeological radiocarbon dates from the island. The resulting estimated demographic declines of the Rapa Nui people are linked to the long-term effects of climate change on the island's carrying capacity and, in turn, on the ‘per-capita food supply’.},

	abstract = {The discovery and settlement of the tiny and remote Easter Island (Rapa Nui) has been a classical controversy for decades. Present-day aboriginal people and their culture are undoubtedly of Polynesian origin, but it has been debated whether Native Americans discovered the island before the Polynesian settlement. Until recently, the paradigm was that Easter Island was discovered and settled just once by Polynesians in their millennial-scale eastward migration across the Pacific. However, the evidence for cultivation and consumption of an American plant—the sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas)—on the island before the European contact (1722 CE), even prior to the Europe-America contact (1492 CE), revived controversy. This paper reviews the classical archaeological, ethnological and paleoecological literature on the subject and summarizes the information into four main hypotheses to explain the sweet potato enigma: the long-distance dispersal hypothesis, the back-and-forth hypothesis, the Heyerdahl hypothesis, and the newcomers hypothesis. These hypotheses are evaluated in light of the more recent evidence (last decade), including molecular DNA phylogeny and phylogeography of humans and associated plants and animals, physical anthropology (craniometry and dietary analysis), and new paleoecological findings. It is concluded that, with the available evidence, none of the former hypotheses may be rejected and, therefore, all possibilities remain open. For future work, it is recommended to use the multiple working hypotheses framework and the strong inference method of hypothesis testing, rather than the ruling theory approach, very common in Easter Island research.},

Las líneas de evidencia independientes que se analizaron para la sección Cuba, muestran cambios en las condiciones ambientales desde finales del Pleistoceno (ca. 13,3 kaAP.) al presente. En general, las concentraciones de polen y esporas en la sección Cuba muestran un efecto de degradación del componente orgánico del suelo a lo largo de la columna estratigráfica. Las tefras presentan concentraciones relativamente altas en la base de la sección, con dos aumentos de concentración importantes en 164 cm y en 95 cm respectivamente. La actividad de fuegos (carbones sedimentarios {\textless}100 y {\textgreater}100μm), presentan valores altos en la base hasta los 12 cm, una marcada disminución alcanzando los valores mínimosentre 120 cm y 65 cm y un nuevo aumento en el tope entre 65 cm y 0 cm.Los valores de isótopos δ13C cambian desde valores muy negativos (-26,4) en la base de la sección (174 cm), hasta valores menos negativos (-22,48) en los 20 cm superiores de la sección. Los datos de la sección Cuba sugieren que la vegetación parece estar respondiendo a los cambios climáticos regionales, particularmente a los cambios de precipitación asociados con la migración de la zona de convergencia Intertropical (máximo térmico Holocénico) y el aumento de la variabilidad en fenómenos del Pacífico Oriental (ENOS).},

Based on a random set of species described in 2007 across all kingdoms of life, we determine that the average shelf life between discovery and description is 21 years.

Though datasets have increased in size and quality in the past years, the contribution of individual genes (and ultimately amino acid sites) to the final phylogeny is unequal across genes. Here we demonstrate that removing a small fraction of sites strongly favoring one topology can produce a highly-supported tree of an alternate topology. We explore this approach using a dataset for animal phylogeny, and create a highly-supported tree with a monophyletic group of sponges and ctenophores, a topology not usually recovered. Because of the high sensitivity of such an analysis to gene selection, and because most gene sets are neither standardized nor representative of the entire genome, researchers should be diligent about making intermediate analyses available with their phylogenetic studies. Effort is needed to ensure these datasets are maximally informative, by ensuring all genes are systematically sampled across relevant species. From there, it could be determined whether any gene or gene sets introduce bias, and then deal with those biases appropriately.},

	abstract = {Over the past decade, it has been discovered that disparate aspects of morphology -  often of distantly related groups of organisms - are regulated by the same genetic  regulatory mechanisms. Those discoveries provide a new perspective on morphological  evolutionary change. A conceptual framework for exploring these research findings is  termed 'deep homology'. A comparative framework for morphological relations of  homology is provided that distinguishes analogy, homoplasy, plesiomorphy and  synapomorphy. Four examples - three from plants and one from animals - demonstrate  that homologous developmental mechanisms can regulate a range of morphological  relations including analogy, homoplasy and examples of uncertain homology. Deep  homology is part of a much wider range of phenomena in which biological (genes,  regulatory mechanisms, morphological traits) and phylogenetic levels of homology can  both be disassociated. Therefore, to understand homology, precise, comparative,  independent statements of both biological and phylogenetic levels of homology are  necessary.},

	abstract = {Although parallel and convergent evolution are discussed extensively in technical articles and textbooks, their meaning can be overlapping, imprecise, and contradictory. The meaning of parallel evolution in much of the evolutionary literature grapples with two separate hypotheses in relation to phenotype and genotype, but often these two hypotheses have been inferred from only one hypothesis, and a number of subsidiary but problematic criteria, in relation to the phenotype. However, examples of parallel evolution of genetic traits that underpin or are at least associated with convergent phenotypes are now emerging. Four criteria for distinguishing parallelism from convergence are reviewed. All are found to be incompatible with any single proposition of homoplasy. Therefore, all homoplasy is equivalent to a broad view of convergence. Based on this concept, all phenotypic homoplasy can be described as convergence and all genotypic homoplasy as parallelism, which can be viewed as the equivalent concept of convergence for molecular data. Parallel changes of molecular traits may or may not be associated with convergent phenotypes but if so describe homoplasy at two biological levels?genotype and phenotype. Parallelism is not an alternative to convergence, but rather it entails homoplastic genetics that can be associated with and potentially explain, at the molecular level, how convergent phenotypes evolve.},

We infer three significant features: a split between low- and high-elevation populations that occurred between 9200 and 8200 BP; a population collapse after European contact that is significantly more severe in South American lowlanders than in highland populations; and evidence for positive selection at genetic loci related to starch digestion and plausibly pathogen resistance after European contact. We do not find selective sweep signals related to known components of the human hypoxia response, which may suggest more complex modes of genetic adaptation to high altitude.},

	url = {https://search.proquest.com/docview/305393070},
	abstract = {Increasing amounts of microbotanical and molecular evidence indicate that humans occupying lowland tropical regions played a central role in the origins of plant domestication and food production in the Americas.  Macroremain and starch grain analyses were carried out on previously excavated stone tools from 15 archaeological sites in Panama, to investigate wild resource use, patterns of crop dispersals throughout Panama and the Neotropics, and the transition to food production in western Pacific Panama (Gran Chiriquí), and central Pacific Panama (Gran Coclé). Results indicate that inhabitants of both regions were using a broad spectrum of local resources during the initial cultivation of exogamous crops, including several types of palm and tree fruits, wild yams (Dioscorea sp.), Calathea, and Zamia (in Gran Chiriquí).  Many of these resources continued to be used after the adoption of domesticates, contributing to the diet breadth of the prehistoric populations.   Domesticated species were adopted in both regions during preceramic periods.  In Gran Chiriquí, arrowroot (Maranta arundinacea) and maize (Zea mays) were available by 6000 BP, and manioc (Manihot esculenta) by 5000 BP.  Starch grain evidence of maize predates macroremains by several millennia, and alters previous suggestions of a late introduction of agriculture in the region.  In Gran Coclé, starch data confirm previous microbotanical evidence for the presence of maize ca. 7000 BP, and its subsequent widespread cultivation.  Manioc, arrowroot, and yams (Dioscorea trifida) were alsocultivated and processed.  Macrobotanical evidence shows that cacao (Theobroma cacao) was grown by 3300 BP in Gran Coclé. Research indicates that crop dispersed relatively rapidly throughout the Neotropics, and independently of one another.  This suggests that most dispersals occurred via diffusion rather than population migration.  When new crops arrived in Gran Chiriquí, the transition to food production appears to have been initially less intense than in Gran Coclé, possibly due to lower population density.  However, in both regions the transition from initial adoption of domesticates to reliance on agriculture and settled village life took several thousand years.  A complex interplay between wild resource availability, crop productivity, population density, and environmental factors directed the nature and pace of this transition.},

	abstract = {Ancient Mesoamericans were making rubber by at least 1600 B.C, mixing latex from Castilla elastica trees with juice from Ipomoea alba (morning glory) vines. The combination of ethnographic, archaeological and mechanical data presented in this text illustrate that ancient Mesoamericans had fully developed this process, and consciously tailored the mechanical properties of rubber to suit requirements of specific applications by altering the ratio of latex to I. alba juice. Our data focus on rubber balls, sandal soles, and rubber bands for hafting and joining. Elasticity, the mechanical property that defines the ability of a rubber ball to bounce, is maximized with a 1:1 volume ratio of latex to I. alba juice. Rubber with high wear resistance, vital to the life and functionality of a sandal sole, can be created by mixing C. elastica latex with 25 percent I. alba juice by volume. Unprocessed C. elastica latex, without I. alba juice, is the material best suited for joining applications, such as adhesives or hafting bands, where strength and ability to absorb shock is of the greatest importance. Tribute data from sixteenth-century codices substantiate that rubber was processed for specific applications within the Aztec empire—rubber and latex goods were processed and constructed in the C. elastica-bearing regions, and then shipped to the capital for use or further distribution.},

	abstract = {Although originally domesticated in tropical America, the sweetpotato [Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam.] has a long history of cultivation in the Pacific region. While the post-Columbus dispersal of sweetpotato to Asia and the Pacific is well documented, the hypothesis that there was a prehistoric transfer of sweetpotato by Peruvian or Polynesian voyagers from Peru to Oceania has long been a controversial issue. The objective of this study was to assess the genetic diversity and interrelationships of sweetpotato landraces from the Pacific region and Latin America, and test the hypothesis of human transfer of this crop to the Pacific Island in prehistoric times. Seventy-five sweetpotato landraces from Peru, Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and 5 Oceania countries were analyzed using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). Multidimensional scaling (MDS) and analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) revealed a large genetic variation in the Oceania gene pool, far greater than that in Peru-Ecuador. The Mexican cultivars were grouped together with those of Oceania. In contrast, there is little association between the Peru-Ecuador germplasm and that of Oceania. These results suggest that Peru-Ecuador may not be the source of the Oceania sweetpotato germplasm. Natural dispersal from Mesoamerica is an alternative explanation, to the ‘Kumara hypothesis’, for the origin of the Oceania sweetpotato.},

	abstract = {Understanding how and why rates of character evolution vary across the Tree of Life is central to many evolutionary questions; for example, does the trophic apparatus (a set of continuous characters) evolve at a higher rate in fish lineages that dwell in reef versus nonreef habitats (a discrete character)? Existing approaches for inferring the relationship between a discrete character and rates of continuous-character evolution rely on comparing a null model (in which rates of continuous-character evolution are constant across lineages) to an alternative model (in which rates of continuous-character evolution depend on the state of the discrete character under consideration). However, these approaches are susceptible to a “straw-man” effect: the influence of the discrete character is inflated because the null model is extremely unrealistic. Here, we describe MuSSCRat, a Bayesian approach for inferring the impact of a discrete trait on rates of continuous-character evolution in the presence of alternative sources of rate variation (“background-rate variation”). We demonstrate by simulation that our method is able to reliably infer the degree of state-dependent rate variation, and show that ignoring background-rate variation leads to biased inferences regarding the degree of state-dependent rate variation in grunts (the fish group Haemulidae).

	abstract = {The relative importance of different modes of evolution in shaping phenotypic diversity remains a hotly debated question. Fossil data suggest that stasis may be a common mode of evolution, while modern data suggest some lineages experience very fast rates of evolution. One way to reconcile these observations is to imagine that evolution proceeds in pulses, rather than in increments, on geological timescales. To test this hypothesis, we developed a maximum-likelihood framework for fitting Lévy processes to comparative morphological data. This class of stochastic processes includes both an incremental and a pulsed component. We found that a plurality of modern vertebrate clades examined are best fitted by pulsed processes over models of incremental change, stationarity, and adaptive radiation. When we compare our results to theoretical expectations of the rate and speed of regime shifts for models that detail fitness landscape dynamics, we find that our quantitative results are broadly compatible with both microevolutionary models and observations from the fossil record.},

	abstract = {Rapid advancements in long-read sequencing technologies have transformed read lengths from bps to Mbps, which has enabled chromosome-scale genome assemblies. However, read lengths are now becoming limited by the extraction of pure high-molecular weight DNA suitable for long-read sequencing, which is particularly challenging in plants and fungi. To overcome this, we present a protocol collection; high-molecular weight DNA extraction, clean-up and size selection for long-read sequencing. We optimised a gentle magnetic bead based high-molecular weight DNA extraction, which is presented here in detail. The protocol circumvents spin columns and high-centrifugation, to limit DNA fragmentation. The protocol is scalable based on tissue input, which can be used on many species of plants, fungi, reptiles and bacteria. It is also cost effective compared to kit-based protocols and hence applicable at scale in low resource settings. An optional sorbitol wash is listed and is highly recommended for plant and fungal tissues. To further remove any remaining contaminants such as phenols and polysaccharides, optional DNA clean-up and size selection strategies are given. This protocol collection is suitable for all common long-read sequencing platforms, such as technologies offered by PacBio and Oxford Nanopore. Using these protocols, sequencing on the Oxford Nanopore MinION can achieve read length N50 values of 30–50 kb, with reads exceeding 200 kb and outputs ranging from 15–30 Gbp. This has been routinely achieved with various plant, fungi, animal and bacteria samples.},

To tackle these challenges we introduce the Sequence Capture Processor (SECAPR) pipeline for processing raw sequencing data into multiple sequence alignments for downstream phylogenetic and phylogeographic analyses. SECAPR is user-friendly and we provide an exhaustive empirical data tutorial intended for users with no prior experience with analyzing MPS output. SECAPR is particularly useful for the processing of sequence capture (synonyms: target or hybrid enrichment) datasets for non-model organisms, as we demonstrate using an empirical sequence capture dataset of the palm genus
              Geonoma
              (Arecaceae). Various quality control and plotting functions help the user to decide on the most suitable settings for even challenging datasets.

	abstract = {A comprehensive account of both basic and advanced material in phylogeny estimation, focusing on computational and statistical issues. No background in biology or computer science is assumed, and there is minimal use of mathematical formulas, meaning that students from many disciplines, including biology, computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics, will find the text accessible. The mathematical and statistical foundations of phylogeny estimation are presented rigorously, following which more advanced material is covered. This includes substantial chapters on multi-locus phylogeny estimation, supertree methods, multiple sequence alignment techniques, and designing methods for large-scale phylogeny estimation. The author provides key analytical techniques to prove theoretical properties about methods, as well as addressing performance in practice for methods for estimating trees. Research problems requiring novel computational methods are also presented, so that graduate students and researchers from varying disciplines will be able to enter the broad and exciting field of computational phylogenetics.},

              sweetpotato collection housed by the International Center of Potato (CIP) is one of the largest assemblages of plant material representing the genetic resources of this important staple crop. The collection currently contains almost 6,000 accessions of
              Ipomoea batatas
              (cultivated sweetpotato) and over 1,000 accessions of sweetpotato crop wild relatives (CWRs). In this study, the entire cultivated collection (5,979 accessions) was genotyped with a panel of 20 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers to assess genetic identity, diversity, and population structure. Genotyping and phenotyping of
              in vitro
              plantlets and mother plants were conducted simultaneously on 2,711 accessions (45\% of the total collection) to identify and correct possible genetic identity errors which could have occurred at any time over the thirty plus years of maintenance in the
              in vitro
              collection. Within this group, 533 accessions (19.6\%) had errors in identity. Field evaluations of morphological descriptors were carried out to confirm the marker data. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to reveal the intraspecific relationships in the population which uncovered high levels of redundancy in material from Peru and Latin America. These genotypic data were supported by morphological data. Population structure analysis demonstrated support for four ancestral populations with many of the accessions having lower levels of gene flow from the other populations. This was especially true of germplasm derived from Peru, Ecuador, and Africa. The set of 20 SSR markers was subsequently utilized to examine a subset of 189 accessions from the USDA sweetpotato germplasm collection and to identify and reconcile potential errors in the identification of clones shared between these collections. Marker analysis demonstrated that the USDA subset of material had 65 unique accessions that were not found in the larger CIP collection. As far as the authors are aware, this is the first report of genotyping an entire sweetpotato germplasm collection in its entirety.},

The phytochemical analyses looked into the alkaloid, flavonoid, cyanogenic glycoside, tannin, phytate and saponin contents of Ipomoea cairica tuber while the proximate composition determination was aimed at the protein, carbohydrate, moisture, lipid, ash and fibre contents. The methods applied for these analytical determinations were mainly those of the Association of Official Analytical Chemist (AOAC, 2005). Each type of analysis (whether proximate or phytochemical) were carried out in triplicate and the mean values determined. The phytochemical analyses showed that Ipomoea cairica tuber had; flavonoid (1.52±0.03 \%), Alkaloid (2.10±0.28 \%), Tannin (0.05 \%), Saponin (1.24±0.04 \%), Cyanogenic glycoside (0.05 \%), and phytate (0.02 \%). The proximate analysis showed that Ipomoea cairica tuber had; Carbohydrate (11.7±0.1 \%), protein (4.2±0.2 \%), ash (0.6±0.1 \%), lipid (0.51±0.07 \%), moisture (72.7±0.2 \%), and fibre (10.3±0.6 \%).

              Motivation
              Principal component analysis (PCA) of genetic data is routinely used to infer ancestry and control for population structure in various genetic analyses. However, conducting PCA analyses can be complicated and has several potential pitfalls. These pitfalls include (i) capturing linkage disequilibrium (LD) structure instead of population structure, (ii) projected PCs that suffer from shrinkage bias, (iii) detecting sample outliers and (iv) uneven population sizes. In this work, we explore these potential issues when using PCA, and present efficient solutions to these. Following applications to the UK Biobank and the 1000 Genomes project datasets, we make recommendations for best practices and provide efficient and user-friendly implementations of the proposed solutions in R packages bigsnpr and bigutilsr.
            
            
              Results
              For example, we find that PC19–PC40 in the UK Biobank capture complex LD structure rather than population structure. Using our automatic algorithm for removing long-range LD regions, we recover 16 PCs that capture population structure only. Therefore, we recommend using only 16–18 PCs from the UK Biobank to account for population structure confounding. We also show how to use PCA to restrict analyses to individuals of homogeneous ancestry. Finally, when projecting individual genotypes onto the PCA computed from the 1000 Genomes project data, we find a shrinkage bias that becomes large for PC5 and beyond. We then demonstrate how to obtain unbiased projections efficiently using bigsnpr. Overall, we believe this work would be of interest for anyone using PCA in their analyses of genetic data, as well as for other omics data.

From the resultant 730 seeds, 248 plants were finally obtained. Ploidy level determination of the proge- ny showed unexpected results: 52 individuals were hexaploid, 5 were pentaploid, 190 were tetraploid, as expected, and one was not determined. The existence of 5x and 6x progenies from 6x x 2x crosses not only con- firmed the presence of 2n gametes but also their success- ful function in gene flow between ploidy levels and poly- ploidization within this genus. The progeny and their cultivated parents were planted in an observation field. The cultivated parents produced 0.49 kg/plant or less. Most 4x progenies did not produce storage roots or had very poor yields; nonetheless, and despite their cultivated parents' poor yields, 8 genotypes yielded between 0.81 and 1.50 kg/plant. A new scheme, using the 4x interspecific hybrids, is proposed for evaluating 2x and 4x wild accessions of the section Batatas to which the sweet potato belongs. Other possible uses of the 4x hybrids in breeding and genetics of the sweet potato are also discussed},

	title = {Growth, yield, and nutritional responses of chamber-grown sweet potato to elevated carbon dioxide levels expected across the next 200 years},
	abstract = {Understanding the effects of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations on crops will be critical to assuring that sufficient food is available to the world's growing population. Previous work has shown that slightly elevated CO2 levels (CO2 = 550-700 ppm) increase the economic yield of most crops by {\textasciitilde}33\%, on average. The majority of these studies have focused on rice, wheat, and soybean; however, climate change is expected to have greatest impact on regions of the world that rely heavily on root crops, such as sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas). Sweet potato is cultivated in more than 100 developing countries; it is ranked seventh in world crop statistics and can produce more edible energy per hectare and per day than wheat, rice or cassava. In order to quantify the effect that rising CO2 levels will have on sweet potato, we grew a total of 64 sweet potato plants to maturity in large controlled growth chambers at ambient, 760, 1,140, and 1,520-ppm CO2 levels. At planting, initial measurements (of mass, length, and number of nodes) for each plant were recorded. Throughout the duration of the experiment (90 days) measurements (of stem length, and number of leaves) were recorded every 7 to 14 days. To ensure optimum growing conditions moisture content was monitored using soil tensiometers; temperature, relative humidity and CO2 concentrations were recorded every ten minutes. Half the plants were supplemented with an inorganic fertilizer and the other half with an organic fertilizer to test the effect of nutrient availability on biomass production under elevated CO2 levels. After 3 months of growth, we measured fresh and dry biomass of all above- and below-ground tissues. Results showed a substantial increase in both above- and below-ground biomass at elevated levels of CO2. For the organic treatment, a 43\% increase in aboveground dry biomass at the highest CO2 concentration (1520ppm) was found; the inorganic treatment showed a 31\% increase. The belowground response was appreciably greater, with a 61\% increase in the organic treatment and 101\% increase in the inorganic treatment. We conclude that the belowground response of root crops under elevated CO2 could have a significant impact on the food supply of developing countries as CO2 levels continue to rise. Ongoing work to quantify the nutritional status of both the leaves for animal feed and the tubers for human consumption will add insight into the quality of the enhanced biomass.},

Nowhere is this need more acute than in the tropics, which harbor the majority of Earth's species and face rapid and large climate and land-use changes. However, the study of species distributions and their responses to climate change in high diversity tropical regions is potentially crippled by a lack of basic data. We analyzed a database representing more than 800000 unique geo-referenced natural history collections to determine what fraction of tropical plant species has sufficient numbers of available collections for use in the habitat or niche models commonly used to predict species responses to climate change. We found that more than nine out of 10 species from the three principle tropical realms are so poorly collected (n {\textless} 20 records) that they are essentially invisible to modern modeling and conservation tools. In order to predict the impact of climate change on tropical species, efforts must be made to increase the amount of data available from tropical countries through a combination of collecting new specimens and digitizing existing records.},

              Recent studies have leveraged large datasets from plot-inventory networks to report a phenomenon of hyperdominance in Amazonian tree communities, concluding that few species are common and many are rare. However, taxonomic hypotheses may not be consistent across these large plot networks, potentially masking cryptic diversity and threatened rare taxa. In the current study, we have reviewed one of the most abundant putatively hyperdominant taxa,
              Protium heptaphyllum
              (Aubl.) Marchand (Burseraceae), long considered to be a taxonomically difficult species complex. Using morphological, genomic, and functional data, we present evidence that
              P. heptaphyllum
              sensu lato may represent eight separately evolving lineages, each warranting species status. Most of these lineages are geographically restricted, and few if any of them could be considered hyperdominant on their own. In addition, functional trait data are consistent with the hypothesis that trees from each lineage are adapted to distinct soil and climate conditions. Moreover, some of the newly discovered species are rare, with habitats currently experiencing rapid deforestation. We highlight an urgent need to improve sampling and methods for species discovery in order to avoid oversimplified assumptions regarding diversity and rarity in the tropics and the implications for ecosystem functioning and conservation.},

In this study, we conceived a pipeline consisting of a genome-wide variation-based phylogeny and a novel haplotype-based phylogenetic analysis (HPA) to determine that the tetraploid accession CIP695141 of Ipomoea batatas 4x from Peru is the tetraploid progenitor of sweet potato. We detected biased gene exchanges between subgenomes. The B1 to B2 subgenome conversions were almost 3-fold higher than the B2 to B1 subgenome conversions. Our analyses revealed that the genes involved in storage root formation, sugar transport, stress resistance, and maintenance of genome stability have been selected during the speciation and domestication of sweet potato. This study sheds lights on the evolution of sweet potato and paves a way for the improvement of sweet potato.},

Focusing on three regions that have a high biocultural diversity, we show that over 75\% of all 12,495 medicinal plant services are linguistically unique—i.e., only known to one language. Whereas most plant species associated with linguistically unique knowledge are not threatened, most languages that report linguistically unique knowledge are. Our finding of high uniqueness in indigenous knowledge and strong coupling with threatened languages suggests that language loss will be even more critical to the extinction of medicinal knowledge than biodiversity loss.},

	abstract = {Abstract The Mata da Pimenteira State Park (MPSP) is an important remnant of caatinga vegetation in the semiarid region of Pernambuco state, Brazil. The park holds great biodiversity, but relatively few taxonomic studies have been undertaken in the area. We present a taxonomic study of Ipomoea in the MPSP based on field observations and collections deposited in the Herbarium of the Semiarid of Brazil - UAST / UFRPE (HESBRA). The species were identified based on the specialized literature, comparisons with type images available online, and protologues. Fourteen species of Ipomoea were identified - more than three times the previously known number. Two Ipomoea species recorded in the MPSP are endemic to Brazil (I. bahiensis and I. brasiliana), three others are exclusive to the Caatinga domain (I. marcellia, I. rosea, and I. tenera), and the remaining are widely distributed in South America. The habit, type and shape of leaf blade and sepals, corolla size and shapes, and presence or absence of subapical rostrum on the external sepals were the most relevant distinctive characteristics. An identification key, descriptions, comments on distribution and diagnostic characteristics, and phenological data of the species are presented.

The three types of Wx-In2 effectively distinguish three diploid constituent genomes of very close homeology in the sweetpotato: Type I is characteristic of some loci in Genome I and III, and Types II and III are specific to loci in Genome II and III. The Type I Wx-In2 variation was found to be retained in 19 sweetpotato lines, Ipomoea littoralis Blume (4×), I. tabascana (4×), and I. tenuissima (2×); Type II to be retained in all 27 sweetpotato lines, I. littoralis Blume, and two I. trifida accessions; Type III to be retained in 13 sweetpotato lines, I. tenuissima, and four distantly related species. Because of the nature of independent random divergence of orthologous intronic sequences, these highly selective retentions of genome-specific or characteristic sweetpotato Wx-In2 variations among four diploid or tetraploid sweetpotato relatives are consistent only with separate lineages of diploid genomes of the sweetpotato. Such an allohexaploid origin of the sweetpotato probably occurred via hybridization between I. tenuissima and I. littoralis Blume, derived earlier from I. trifida and an unidentified species sibling to I. tenuissima. However, neither the involvement of I. tabascana nor a multiple origin of the sweetpotato can be ruled out. The inference is supported by maximal likelihood relationships between the three types of Wx-In2 from the sweetpotato and Wx-In2 from its 11 closest relatives. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Therefore, this study aims to evaluate the presence of IbT-DNAs in the genomes of sweetpotato's wild relatives belonging to the taxonomic group series Batatas. Both IbT-DNA1 and IbT-DNA2 were found in tetraploid I. batatas (L.) Lam. and had highly similar sequences and at the same locus to those found in the cultivated sweetpotato. Moreover, IbT-DNA1 was also found in I. cordatotriloba and I. tenuissima while IbT-DNA2 was detected in I. trifida.

	doi = {10/gmvm8r},
	abstract = {Twenty-four accessions of Ipomoea, representing 13 species of section Batatas and the outgroup species I. gracilis and I. pes-caprae were analyzed for restriction fragment length polymorphisms. Polymorphisms were detected by probing Southern blots of restriction enzyme-digested genomic DNA with 20 low or moderate copy number sequences isolated from an I. batatas CV. Georgia Red genomic library. Data were analyzed cladistically and phenet-ically. Ipomoea trifida, I. tabascana, and collection K233 are, of the materials examined, the most closely related to sweetpotato (I. batatas). Ipomoea littoralis, the only Old World species in the section, is a sister species to I. tiliacea. Ipomoea littoralis, I. umbraticola, I. peruviana, I. cynanchifolia, and I. gracilis are shown to be diploid (2n = 2x = 30). In contrast, I. tabascana is tetraploid (2n = 4x = 60). The intrasectional relationships of section Batatas species and the role of tetraploid related species in the evolution of the cultivated I. batatas are discussed. Sweetpotato production worldwide exceeded 1.3 × 10 8 Mt in 1989 (Food and Agriculture Organization, 1990), and the enormous potential of this crop as a carbohydrate source is widely recognized. To increase current production levels, new genes for resistance to various biotic and abiotic factors must be iden-tified. Resistance to many important diseases and insects does not appear to be present in the I. batatas gene pool, which has focused attention on the use of exotic germplasm for sweetpo-tato improvement (Iwanaga, 1988; Orjeda et al., 1990). Nishi-yama and Teramura (1962) were the first to use exotic germplasm in the form of the feral sweetpotato segregate K123 (Jones, 1967). Resistance to sweetpotato weevil (Cylas spp.), scab [El-sinoe batatas (Saw.) Viegas and Jenkins], and black rot (Cer-atocystis fimbriata Ell. et Halst.) have been identified in plants reported as I. trifida and I. littoralis (Iwanaga, 1988). While the potential for the use of most section Batatas species in sweetpotato improvement has yet to be ascertained, other dis-tantly related species contribute indirectly; I. setosa L. and I. carnea ssp. fistulosa Mart., ex Choisy are used as virus-indicator and flower-inducing rootstock, respectively. Increased aware-ness of the potential contribution of Ipomoea spp. to sweetpotato improvement is reflected in the recent efforts to collect and establish gene banks of these materials (de la Puente, 1988; Jarret et al., 1989). Until recently, species boundaries in Ipomoea sect. Batatas were poorly understood. As a result, many species names have been misapplied in the taxonomic and agronomic literature, and different workers have often described similar and/or identical materials under different names, or material of distinct species under the same name. Austin (1978) provided a taxonomic re-vision of section Batatas based on the study of several hundred},

The stages in polyploid evolution include frequent fertility bottlenecks and infrequent events such as gametic nonreduction and interspecific hybridization, yet little is known about how these and other factors influence overall rates of polyploid formation. Here we review the literature regarding polyploid origins, and quantify parameter values for each of the steps involved in the principal pathways. In contrast to the common claim that triploids are sterile, our results indicate that the triploid bridge pathway can contribute significantly to autopolyploid formation regardless of the mating system, and to allopolyploid formation in outcrossing taxa. We estimate that the total rate of autotetraploid formation is of the same order as the genic mutation rate (1 O-5), and that a high frequency of interspecific hybridization (0.2\% for selfing taxa, 2.7\% for outcrossing taxa) is required for the rate of tetraploid formation via allopolyploidy to equal that by autopolyploidy. We conclude that the rate of autopolyploid formation may often be higher than the rate of allopolyploid formation. Further progress toward understanding polyploid origins requires studies in natural populations that quantify: (a) the frequency of unredluced gametes, (b) the effectiveness of triploid bridge pathways, and (c) the rates of interspecific hybridization.},

Here, we provide an overview of the current knowledge on the pathways leading to different types of polyploids and patterns of polyploidy-induced genome restructuring and functional changes in plants. Available evidence leads to a tentative 'diverge, merge and diverge' model supporting polyploid speciation and stressing patterns of divergence between diploid progenitors as a suitable predictor of polyploid genome reorganization. The merging of genomes at the origin of a polyploid lineage may indeed reveal different kinds of incompatibilities (chromosomal, genic and transposable elements) that have accumulated in diverging progenitors and reduce the fitness of nascent polyploids. Accordingly, successful polyploids have to overcome these incompatibilities through non-Mendelian mechanisms, fostering polyploid genome reorganization in association with the establishment of new lineages.

A wide variation in many characters of leaf, stem and root, as well as selfor cross-incompatibility, was found among these lines. K123 is closely related to the sweet potato in its main characters, but it is readily distinguished by certain wild characters, e.g. development of non-edible roots, twining and climbing stems, slender stems and heavy pubescence on stems, petioles, leaves and peduncles, etc. In addition to the cytological facts, the present study has offered further evidence for the assumption that K123 is the ancestral wild form of the modern sweet potato.},

	abstract = {Sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas (L.) Lam., Convolvulaceae) counts among the most widely cultivated staple crops worldwide, yet the origins of its domestication remain unclear. This hexaploid species could have had either an autopolyploid origin, from the diploid I. trifida, or an allopolyploid origin, involving genomes of I. trifida and I. triloba. We generated molecular genetic data for a broad sample of cultivated sweet potatoes and its diploid and polyploid wild relatives, for noncoding chloroplast and nuclear ITS sequences, and nuclear SSRs. Our data did not support an allopolyploid origin for I. batatas, nor any contribution of I. triloba in the genome of domesticated sweet potato. I. trifida and I. batatas are closely related although they do not share haplotypes. Our data support an autopolyploid origin of sweet potato from the ancestor it shares with I. trifida, which might be similar to currently observed tetraploid wild Ipomoea accessions. Two I. batatas chloroplast lineages were identified. They show more divergence with each other than either does with I. trifida. We thus propose that cultivated I. batatas have multiple origins, and evolved from at least two distinct autopolyploidization events in polymorphic wild populations of a single progenitor species. Secondary contact between sweet potatoes domesticated in Central America and in South America, from differentiated wild I. batatas populations, would have led to the introgression of chloroplast haplotypes of each lineage into nuclear backgrounds of the other, and to a reduced divergence between nuclear gene pools as compared with chloroplast haplotypes.},

              is a large pantropical genus globally distributed, which importance goes beyond the economic value as food resources or ornamental crops. This highly diverse genus has been the focus of a great number of studies, enriching the plant genomics knowledge, and challenging the plant evolution models. In the Carajás mountain range, located in Eastern Amazon, the savannah-like ferruginous ecosystem known as
              canga
              harbors highly specialized plant and animal populations, and
              Ipomoea
              is substantially representative in such restrictive habitat. Thus, to provide genetic data and insights into whole plastome phylogenetic relationships among key
              Ipomoea
              species from Eastern Amazon with little to none previously available data, we present the complete plastome sequences of twelve lineages of the genus, including the

            Species are crucial to most branches of biological research, yet remain controversial in terms of definition, delimitation, and reality. The difficulty of resolving the “species problem” stems from the tension between their theoretical concept as groups of evolving and highly variable organisms and the practical need for a stable and comparable unit of biology. Here, we suggest that treating species as a heuristic can be consistent with a theoretical definition of what species are and with the practical means by which they are identified and delimited. Specifically, we suggest that theoretically species are heuristic since they comprise clusters of closely related individuals responding in a similar manner to comparable sets of evolutionary and ecological forces, whilst they are practically heuristic because they are identifiable by the congruence of contingent properties indicative of those forces. This reconciliation of the theoretical basis of species with their practical applications in biological research allows for a loose but relatively consistent definition of species based on the strategic analysis and integration of genotypic, phenotypic, and ecotypic data.

	abstract = {A robust molecular phylogeny provides insights into evolutionary history because it illustrates the order that different taxa have diverged from each other, and the changes that have accumulated between different taxa over evolutionary history. However, a molecular phylogeny does not provide information about a range of other fundamental parameters in macroevolutionary research. This includes the absolute time-scale over which a clade has evolved, and the rate that different clades have diversified. In order to estimate absolute time-scales (referred to as divergence time estimation), and infer net diversification rates, speciation rates, and extinction rates (referred to as diversification parameter estimation), additional analyses are therefore required. As robust phylogenies are inferred for an increasing number of groups, and complex analyses are performed to infer macroevolutionary parameters in a greater variety of contexts, evaluating the robustness of methods for inferring divergence times and diversification parameters is more important than ever. Here, I evaluate the robustness of methods for inferring divergence times and diversification parameters. I show that even in the context of genomic scale datasets, among-branch-substitution-rate-variation that acts consistently across entire genomes causes considerable error in divergence time estimates, regardless of the quantity of molecular sequence data that is sampled. I then show that methods that implement multiple fossil calibrations with relaxed clock methods, which are designed to account for among-branch-substitution-rate-variation, make unrealistic assumptions about the fossil record. I show that these unrealistic assumptions are likely to be a further source of error in divergence time estimates. I then characterise the implications of these problems for estimating divergence times and diversification parameters within Ipomoea, and show that they can lead to very uncertain inferences. However, I show that if questions are carefully framed, and the assumptions of different methods fully accounted for, robust inferences can be made. This includes the inference that the storage root of the Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas) evolved in pre-human times, challenging the existing paradigm that it evolved relatively recently as a result of human domestication. It also includes the inference that there is a significant increase in net diversification rates for a clade of Neotropical Ipomoea that is of a scale equivalent to some of the most iconic radiations in the plant kingdom. Taken together, this thesis illustrates fundamental problems that underlie methods in macroevolutionary research, but highlights that when methods are used in the right context, they can serve as a basis for making novel and robust inferences about the natural world.},

An account of the genus Ipomoea L. in Bolivia is presented. 102 species are recognised as growing in the country and each of these is described and notes are provided on diagnostic features, distribution, habitat, phenology and conservation status. A dichotomous key to all species is provided together with additional informal keys focussing on outstanding features of morphology and ecology. Line drawings illustrate the new species described and photographs are provided to facilitate identification and draw attention to key diagnostic features. Maps of the distribution in Bolivia of selected species are also provided. 16 species are described as new of which 13 are endemic to Bolivia: Ipomoea appendiculata J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland, I. chiquitensis J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland, I. exserta J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland, I. gypsophila J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland, I. huayllae J. R. I. Wood \& R. W.

The name I. paludicola J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland is provided for the plant usually treated as a form of I. asarifolia (Desr.) Roem. \& Schult. but originally described by Meismer under the illegitimate name I. serpens Meisn. The new combination Ipomoea hewittacea (Kuntze) J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland is made and is the correct name for the plant currently known as Ipomoea piresii O’Donell. The hitherto accepted names Ipomoea echioides Choisy, I. pedata G. Don, I. philipsonii O’ Donell, I. peredoi O’Donell, I. santacrucensis O’Donell, I. sawyeri D.F. Austin and I. tapirapoanensis Hoehne are treated as synonyms of, respectively, I. paulistana (Silva Manso) Stellfeld, I. maurituana Jacq. , I. bataoides Choisy, I. reticulata O’Donell, I. oranensis O’Donell, I. neurocephala Hall. f., and I. caloneura Meisn. Ipomoea subtomentosa (Chodat \& Hassl.) O’ Donell is treated as a var. subtomentosa (Chodat \& Hassl.) J. R. I. Wood \& R. W. Scotland of I. maurandioides Meisn. and a new variety erecta J. R. I.

All 423 species are described and information is provided on their ecology and distribution, with citations from all countries from which they are reported. Notes are provided on salient characteristics and taxonomic issues related to individual species. A full synonymy is provided and many names are lectotypified. An extensive introduction discusses the delimitation and history of Ipomoea arguing that a broad generic concept is the only rational solution in the light of recent phylogenetic advances. Although no formal infrageneric classification is proposed, attention is drawn to the major clades of the genus and several morphologically well-defined clades are discussed including those traditionally treated under the names Arborescens, Batatas, Pharbitis, Calonyction and Quamoclit. Identification keys are provided on a regional basis including multi-entry keys for the main continental blocks. Six species are described as new, Ipomoea nivea J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland from Peru, I. apodiensis from Brazil, I. calcicola J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, I. pochutlensis J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, I. zacatecana J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and I. ramulosa J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland from Mexico, while var. australis of I. cordatotriloba is raised to specific status as I. australis (O’Donell) J.R.I. Wood \& P. Muñoz. New subspecies for I. nitida (subsp. krapovickasii J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) and for I. chenopodiifolia (subsp. bellator J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) are described. The status of previously recognized species and varieties is changed to subspecies for I. amnicola (subsp. chiliantha (Hallier f.) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland), I. chenopodiifolia (subsp. signata (House) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland), I. orizabensis (subsp. collina (House) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, subsp. austromexicana (J.A. McDonald) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and subsp. novogaliciana (J.A. McDonald) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland), I. setosa (subsp. pavonii (Hallier f.) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, subsp. melanotricha (Brandegee), J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and subsp. sepacuitenensis (Donn. Sm.) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) and I. ternifolia (subsp. leptotoma (Torrey) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland.). I. subincana and I. angustata are treated as var. angustata (Brandegee) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and var. subincana (Choisy) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland of I. barbatisepala and I. brasiliensis respectively. Attention is drawn to a number of hitherto poorly recognized phenomena in the genus including a very large radiation centred on the Parana region of South America and another on the Caribbean Islands, a strong trend towards an amphitropical distribution in the New World, the existence of a relatively large number of species with a pantropical distribution and of many species in different clades with storage roots, most of which have never been evaluated for economic purposes. The paper is illustrated with 208 figures composed of line drawings and photographs.},

However, such studies, now rare, are often considered too daunting to undertake within a realistic time frame, especially as the world's collections have doubled in size in recent times. Here, we report a global-scale monographic study of morning glories (Ipomoea) that integrated DNA barcodes and high-throughput sequencing with the morphological study of herbarium specimens. Our approach overhauled the taxonomy of this megadiverse group, described 63 new species and uncovered significant increases in net diversification rates comparable to the most iconic evolutionary radiations in the plant kingdom. Finally, we show that more than 60 species of Ipomoea, including sweet potato, independently evolved storage roots in pre-human times, indicating that the storage root is not solely a product of human domestication but a trait that predisposed the species for cultivation. This study demonstrates how the world's natural history collections can contribute to global challenges in the Anthropocene.},

	abstract = {Circumscriptions of the genus Hibiscus and the tribe Hibisceae (Malvaceae) are based on morphological features that are not unique in the family. An examination of the literature regarding putatively ancestral morphological features revealed that Hibiscus and Hibisceae may be defined by shared ancestral features, and thus are unlikely to be monophyletic groups. These phylogenetic hypotheses were tested using two chloroplast DNA sequences (a coding region—ndhF, and a non-coding region—the rpl16 intron). Several genera usually placed in Hibisceae were found to occupy positions sister to the rest of the family, as was predicted from our reevaluation of their morphological features. Although the earliest divergences in the family were not resolved by chloroplast DNA topologies alone, several morphological features, when analysed in combination with ndhF, suggested a possible resolution of the basal polytomy. These early divergences are represented by extant genera with relatively restricted distributions, which all possess Australasian species that are sister to more widespread and diverse lineages. This suggests the novel hypothesis that eastern Gondwana may be the centre of origin of the family. The pollen fossil record is consistent with this possibility, but does not support it unambiguously. Unexpectedly the tribes Decaschistieae and Malvavisceae as well as other genera of Hibisceae nest within Hibiscus. Nomenclatural upheavals concerning Hibiscus, one of the world's most popular horticultural plant genera, will be difficult to avoid.},

	abstract = {The generic classification of Hibisceae has long been unstable. A new understanding of the phylogeny of Hibisceae has found that genera from three tribes (Decaschistieae, Hibisceae and Malvavisceae) are nested within Hibiscus. We discuss issues that impinge upon the classification of Hibiscus in a general sense, including the genus concept, monophyletic and paraphyletic taxa, the use of characters and phylogenies to define taxa, and the current ranked system (based on the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature) v. a rank free alternative (the PhyloCode). We conclude that genera are subjective constructs that are only real in the sense of their phylogenetic origins (i.e. the taxa they denote may be real discoverable monophyletic groups), that paraphyletic taxa are not necessary in classification, that overemphasis of ‘distinctive’ characters in preference to phylogenies leads to recognition of paraphyletic taxa, and that there is no objective fixed and discoverable rank for any taxon. While the PhyloCode avoids some of these problems, it fails to adequately provide an alternative to the mnemonically powerful and information rich Linnean binomial and its advantages do not, in our opinion, outweigh the utility of the ICBN system when the latter employs only monophyletic taxa. With these conclusions in mind, we offer a brief set of guidelines for higher level classification and apply this to Hibiscus. The severe paraphyly in Hibiscus means that no classification using the ICBN system with exclusively monophyletic taxa will be free of major nomenclatural changes. We argue that including over 200 species from several genera within a broadly defined Hibiscus causes fewer nomenclatural changes overall than do alternative schemes, while promoting stability and attempting to minimise change to well known species. A hybrid formal ranked and informal rank free system is discussed and proposed for this group. A series of rank free names that are nested within Hibiscus s.l. are proposed to convey information about membership of distinctive clades within Hibiscus s.l. in lieu of a complete ranked subgeneric classification that awaits more investigation.},

For the elaboration of the catalogue of the vascular flora of the CNP, we compiled, refined and analysed the information available in the herbaria of the University of Azuay (Cuenca, Ecuador) (HA), Missouri Botanical Garden (MO), Pontificia Universidad Católica de Ecuador (QCA) and Tropicos® database, with records of altitudes above 3300 m asl and our collections in the years 2012-2019. 666 species are documented, belonging to 264 genera and 89 botanical families; we describe their biological form (biotype), habitat, distribution ‒with special attention to endemic and non-native species‒ and degree of threat. Finally, the data for each of these criteria are jointly analysed and compared with other Andean mountain ranges. Dichondra macrocalyx Meisn. and Piptochaetium tovarii Sánchez Vega are reported for the first time in Ecuador.},

              Heritable microorganisms play critical roles in life cycles of many macro-organisms but their prevalence and functional roles are unknown for most plants. Bioactive ergot alkaloids produced by heritable
              Periglandula
              fungi occur in some morning glories (Convolvulaceae), similar to ergot alkaloids in grasses infected with related fungi. Ergot alkaloids have been of longstanding interest given their toxic effects, psychoactive properties, and medical applications. Here we show that ergot alkaloids are concentrated in four morning glory clades exhibiting differences in alkaloid profiles and are more prevalent in species with larger seeds than those with smaller seeds. Further, we found a phylogenetically-independent, positive correlation between seed mass and alkaloid concentrations in symbiotic species. Our findings suggest that heritable symbiosis has diversified among particular clades by vertical transmission through seeds combined with host speciation, and that ergot alkaloids are particularly beneficial to species with larger seeds. Our results are consistent with the defensive symbiosis hypothesis where bioactive ergot alkaloids from
              Periglandula
              symbionts protect seeds and seedlings from natural enemies, and provide a framework for exploring microbial chemistry in other plant-microbe interactions.},

The identification of genes and mechanisms responsible for resistance to RKN will facilitate the development of RKN resistant cultivars not only in sweetpotato but also in other crops. In this study, we performed RNA-seq analysis of RKN resistant cultivars (RCs; Danjami, Pungwonmi and Juhwangmi) and susceptible cultivars (SCs; Dahomi, Shinhwangmi and Yulmi) of sweetpotato infected with
              M. incognita
              to examine the induced and constitutive defense response-related transcriptional changes. During induced defense, genes related to defense and secondary metabolites were induced in SCs, whereas those related to receptor protein kinase signaling and protein phosphorylation were induced in RCs. In the uninfected control, genes involved in proteolysis and biotic stimuli showed differential expression levels between RCs and SCs during constitutive defense. Additionally, genes related to redox regulation, lipid and cell wall metabolism, protease inhibitor and proteases were putatively identified as RKN defense-related genes. The root transcriptome of SCs was also analyzed under uninfected conditions, and several potential candidate genes were identified. Overall, our data provide key insights into the transcriptional changes in sweetpotato genes that occur during induced and constitutive defense responses against RKN infection.},

	abstract = {Drought, ultraviolet-B (UV-B), and nitrogen stress are significant constraints for sweetpotato productivity. Their impact on plant growth and development can be acute, resulting in low productivity. Identifying phenotypes that govern stress tolerance in sweetpotatoes is highly desirable to develop elite cultivars with better yield. Ten sweetpotato cultivars were grown under nonstress (100\% replacement of evapotranspiration (ET)), drought-stress (50\% replacement of ET), UV-B (10 kJ), and low-nitrogen (20\% LN) conditions. Various shoot and root morphological, physiological, and gas-exchange traits were measured at the early stage of the crop growth to assess its performance and association with the storage root number. All three stress factors caused significant changes in the physiological and root- and shoot-related traits. Drought stress reduced most shoot developmental traits (29\%) to maintain root growth. UV-B stress increased the accumulation of plant pigments and decreased the photosynthetic rate. Low-nitrogen treatment decreased shoot growth (11\%) and increased the root traits (18\%). The highly stable and productive cultivars under all four treatments were identified using multitrait stability index analysis and weighted average of absolute scores (WAASB) analyses. Further, based on the total stress response indices, ‘Evangeline’, ‘O’Henry’, and ‘Beauregard B-14’ were identified as vigorous under drought; ‘Evangeline’, ‘Orleans’, and ‘Covington’ under UV-B; and ‘Bonita’, ‘Orleans’, and ‘Beauregard B-14’ cultivars showed greater tolerance to low nitrogen. The cultivars ‘Vardaman’ and ‘NC05-198’ recorded a low tolerance index across stress treatments. This information could help determine which plant phenotypes are desirable under stress treatment for better productivity. The cultivars identified as tolerant, sensitive, and well-adapted within and across stress treatments can be used as source materials for abiotic stress tolerance breeding programs.},

Roem. \& Schult., família Convolvulaceae, tem sido apontada por causar intoxicações em bovinos, caprinos e ovinos, principalmente durante os períodos de estiagem na região semiárida do Brasil. Neste sentido, o presente estudo teve como objetivo realizar uma revisão de literatura sobre os casos de intoxicações naturais e experimentais causadas por I. asarifolia em ruminantes, e listar os principais compostos químicos que ocorrem nesta planta. Para isso, foram realizadas consultas nas bases de dados SciELO, Google Acadêmico, ScienceDirect e PubMed, utilizando palavras-chave específicas sobre o tema. Um total de 24 artigos científicos publicados nos últimos 20 anos (2001-2021) foram selecionados e incluídos nesta revisão. Vários autores relataram que os principais sinais clínicos apresentados por bovinos, caprinos e ovinos intoxicados por I. asarifolia são: tremores musculares, desequilíbrio e incoordenação motora. Estes casos foram notificados nos estados do Rio Grande do Norte, Paraíba, Piauí, Ceará, Sergipe, Pernambuco, Tocantins e Pará. As principais classes químicas que ocorrem em I. asarifolia são: compostos fenólicos, terpenos e alcaloides diterpênicos indólicos. É provável que os alcaloides indólicos estejam associados aos casos de intoxicações por esta planta. Sugere-se que novos estudos sejam desenvolvidos com o intuito de elucidar os mecanismos de ação dos compostos químicos de I. asarifolia no organismo dos animais.},

	doi = {10.1080/10635150701701083},
	abstract = {The issue of species delimitation has long been confused with that of species conceptualization, leading to a half century of controversy concerning both the definition of the species category and methods for inferring the boundaries and numbers of species. Alternative species concepts agree in treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the primary defining property of the species category, but they disagree in adopting different properties acquired by lineages during the course of divergence (e.g., intrinsic reproductive isolation, diagnosability, monophyly) as secondary defining properties (secondary species criteria). A unified species concept can be achieved by treating existence as a separately evolving metapopulation lineage as the only necessary property of species and the former secondary species criteria as different lines of evidence (operational criteria) relevant to assessing lineage separation. This unified concept of species has several consequences for species delimitation, including the following: First, the issues of species conceptualization and species delimitation are clearly separated; the former secondary species criteria are no longer considered relevant to species conceptualization but only to species delimitation. Second, all of the properties formerly treated as secondary species criteria are relevant to species delimitation to the extent that they provide evidence of lineage separation. Third, the presence of any one of the properties (if appropriately interpreted) is evidence for the existence of a species, though more properties and thus more lines of evidence are associated with a higher degree of corroboration. Fourth, and perhaps most significantly, a unified species concept shifts emphasis away from the traditional species criteria, encouraging biologists to develop new methods of species delimitation that are not tied to those properties.},

	doi = {10.3906/bot-1405-34},
	abstract = {Salvia L. in its traditional circumscription is the largest genus within the mint family. To date, the magnitude of the task has rendered it difficult to provide a genus-wide revision based on morphological data. Current molecular investigations based on a dense taxon sampling representing the whole phenotypic diversity and distribution range of Salvia confirmed that the genus is polyphyletic. Salvia species fall in 4 distinct clades, although all of them, except Clade IV, also include non-Salvia genera. A taxonomic revision is thus urgently needed with two different approaches that have to be considered: (1) to include the 5 morphologically distinct non-Salvia genera in Salvia or (2) to split Salvia s.l. into Salvia s.s. and several additional genera. Since Salvia is already highly heterogeneous in species distribution, morphology, and chromosome number, we prefer to split the genus into molecularly well-supported clades. This new concept may facilitate monographic studies and more focused analyses of character evolution within or between the clades. Species
representing Salvia sect. Eremosphace Bunge (subclade III-A) were chosen exemplarily to provide arguments for elevating this particular group to the level of genus (Pleudia Raf.).},

Phenetic and principal coordinate analysis of the 56 polymorphisms detected within the hexaploid I. batatas clearly delineated the South Pacific and the Peruvian sweetpotato lines . The two U .S . cultivars clustered with the Oceanic materials. Cladistic and phenetic analysis of 8 Ipomoea species supports previously published phylogenies based on morphological and RFLP data . Among the species examined, I. tabascana, I. trifida and the tetraploid forms of I. batatas from Mexico and Ecuador, including I. batatas var. apiculata, are the taxa most closely related to the cultivated hexaploid I. batatas . These findings support the utility of RAPD markers for evaluating genetic diversity in sweetpotato and for establishing taxonomic and evolutionary relationships in Ipomoea.},

            We present a phylogenetic analysis using plastid (matK, rbcL) and nuclear (nrITS) DNA for diverse Euploca spp. (formerly Heliotropium section Orthostachys) from the worldwide distribution of a genus and including species encompassing the wide physiological and morphological diversity of the genus. Our results indicate that some remarkably complex features arose multiple times in parallel in Euploca, including attributes of its subsections under section Orthostachys, notably plants that, above ground, consist almost entirely of inflorescences. To elucidate in greater detail the distribution of C4 species in Euploca and Heliotropium s.s., we made \&gt; 800 δ 13C determinations, including some from the traditional genus Tournefortia. We greatly increase the number of proven C4 species in Euploca, but found none outside Euploca. Of the tested Euploca spp., c. 28\% are C3 or intermediate in carbon fixation pathway. Our phylogenetic results indicate four parallel/convergent acquisitions of C4 photosynthesis or fewer origins with subsequent loss in some species.},

Why on earth has the entirely land-loving Eastern Mole been named Scalopus aquaticus, or the Oxford Ragwort been called Senecio squalidus - 'dirty old man'? What were naturalists thinking when they called a beetle Agra katewinsletae, a genus of fish Batman, and a Trilobite Han solo? Why is zoology replete with names such as Chloris chloris chloris (the greenfinch), and Gorilla gorilla gorilla (a species of, well gorilla)? The Naming of the Shrew will unveil these mysteries, exploring the history, celebrating their poetic nature and revealing how naturalists sometimes get things so terribly wrong. With wonderfully witty style and captivating narrative, this book will make you see Latin names in a whole new light},

	abstract = {Covering 560.14 hectares in the south-east of Benin, the Ewe-Adakplame Relic Forest (EARF) is a micro-refugium that shows insular characteristics within the Dahomey Gap. It is probably one of the last remnants of tropical rain forest that would have survived the late Holocene dry period. Based on intensive field investigations through 25 plots (10 × 50 m size) and matching of herbarium specimens, a checklist of 185 species of vascular plant belonging to 54 families and 142 genera is presented for this forest. In addition to the name for each taxon, we described the life form following Raunkiaer’s definitions, chorology as well as threats to habitat. The Rubiaceae family was the richest (20 species) followed by the Fabaceae (15 species). Life forms showed the preponderance of phanerophytes (88\%). The Chorological spectrum was dominated by Guineo-Congolean species (66\%). Species richness estimated were 200.52 ± 9.2808 for Bootstrap; 217.62 ± 14.5972; 224.16 ± 15.3725 and 242.67 respectively for Chao, Jacknife1 and Jacknife2. Bootstrap appears to be the estimation closer to the field records. In Benin, EARF is home for Rinorea species described as West African forest bio-indicators and single location for Nesogordonia papaverifera, Mansonia altissima, Englerophytum oblanceolatum, Octolobus spectabilis, Vitex micrantha and most of Drypeteae tribe species ( Drypetes aframensis, Drypetes afzelii, Drypetes gilgiana and Drypetes leonensis ) recorded in Benin. Our results provides baseline information for further in-depth analysis of vegetation history in Benin by raising the question on the past floristic connection of the Dahomey gap and community engagement in conservation.},

	abstract = {The first comprehensive plant checklist for the Bvumba massif, situated in the Manica Highlands along the Zimbabwe-Mozambique border, is presented. Although covering only 276 km, the flora is rich with 1250 taxa (1127 native taxa and 123 naturalised introductions). There is a high proportion of Orchidaceae and Pteridophyta, with both groups showing a higher richness than for adjacent montane areas, which may be due to the massif’s relatively high moisture levels as a result of frequent cloud cover. However, in contrast to other mesic montane regions in southern Africa, there are relatively few near-endemic or range-restricted taxa: there is only one local endemic,
              Aeranthes africana
              , an epiphytic forest orchid. This is likely to be an effect of the massif having limited natural grassland compared to forest, the former being the most endemic-rich habitat in southern African mountains outside of the Fynbos Biome. Six other near-endemic taxa with limited distribution in this portion of the Manica Highlands are highlighted. The high number of invasive species is probably a result of diverse human activities in the area. The main species of concern are Acacia melanoxylon, a tree that is invading grassland and previously cultivated land, the forest herb Hedychium gardnerianum which in places is transforming forest understorey with an adverse effect on some forest birds, and the woody herb Vernonanthura polyanthes which invades cleared forest areas after fire. Future botanical work in the massif should focus on a more detailed exploration of the poorly known Serra Vumba on the Mozambican side and on the drier western slopes. This will allow for a more detailed analysis of patterns of endemism across the Manica Highlands.},

	abstract = {Ipomoea pes-caprae (L.) Roth (railroad vine) is a pantropical, perennial, trailing vine (Convolvulaceae with showy pink flowers that grows on coastal beaches and dunes throughout the tropical and subtropica areas of the world. Here I present a summary of ecological, physiological and geomorphological aspect of the biology of I. pes-caprae. Its success as a colonizer of tropical shorelines may be attributed to thi production of large numbers of fruits, long life cycle, high potential for water dispersal, resistance to sal spray, rapid growth, large neighborhood size, and vegetative reproduction. The species is important as j sand colonizer and plays a significant role in geomorphology. The plants often cover large areas and forn a rather continuous mat that helps to keep the sand from moving and holds the substrate together. The flowers are visited by bees and other insects; Xylocopa species (Hymenoptera) are important pollinators Ants visit extrafloral nectaries and help the plant increase reproductive success in some areas. The leave and seeds contain the indole alkaloid ergotamine, which protects them from many herbivores. Flower are sometimes eaten by herbivores, and a beetle (Megacerus leucospilus) parasitizes the seeds. /// Ipomoea pes-caprae (L.) Roth ist eine pantropische, perennierende Windepflanze (Convolvulaceae) mit auffälligen rosafarbenen Blüten, die weltweit auf allen tropischen und subtropischen Meeresstränden und Dünen wächst. In diesem Aufsatz wird eine Zusammenfassung ökologischer, physiologischer und geomorphologischer Aspekte im Leben von I. pes-caprae gegeben. Der Erfolg als Kolonisator von tropischen Stränden mag in der Tatsache begründet sein, daß eine große Anzahl von Früchten produziert wird, ein langer Lebenszyklus, ein hohes Potential zur Wasserverteilung und eine Resistenz gegen Salzaufwehung existiert, weiterhim ein schnelles Wachstum stattfindet, der eingenommene Siedlungsraum der Pflanzengesellschaft groß ist und eine vegatative Vermehrung möglich ist. Diese Pflanzenart ist ein wichtiger Kolonisator auf sandigem Untergrund und spielt aus deshalb auch eine bedeutsame Rolle bei geomorphologischen Prozessen im Strand- und Dünenbereich. Die Pflanzen bedecken oft ausgedehnte Gebiete und bilden eine weitestgehend zusammenhängende Matte, die deutlich zur Verminderung der Sandbewegung bzw. Fixierung des Seidmentes beiträgt. Die Blüten werden von Bienen und anderen Insekten besucht. Eine wichtige Funktion haben hier Xylocopa-Arten, die zu den Hymenóptera (Hautflügler) gehören. Ameisen suchen extraflorale Nektarien (Honigdrüsen außerhalb der Blüten) auf und helfen somit die Vermehrungsrate in manchen Gebieten zu erhöhen. Die Blätter und Samen enthalten das Indolalkaloid Ergotamin, welches sie vor vielen Pflanzenfressern schützt. Die Blüten werden manchmal von herbivoren Tieren gefressen und der Käfer (Megacerus leucospilus) ist ein Samenparasit bei I. pes-caprae. /// Ipomoea pes-caprae (L) Roth est une vigne pantropicale, perenne et grimpante (Convolvulacées). Elle a des fleurs d'un rose éclatant et pousse sur les plages et les dunes littorales des zones tropicales et subtropicales. On présente un résumé des facteurs écologiques, physiologiques et géomorphologiques de la biologie de Ipomoea pes-caprae. Son succès à coloniser les littoraux tropicaux peut être attribué à ce qu'elle produit un grand nombre de fruits, qu'elle a un cycle de vie long, un haut potentiel de dispersion de l'eau, qu'elle résiste aux embruns, croît rapidement, est fortement colonisatrice et a une reproduction végétative. Cette espèce, colonisatrice des sables, joue un rôle essentiel pour la géomorphologie. Elle couvre de vastes zones et forme un tapis assez continu qui fixe les sables et maintient le subtrat. Les fleurs, visitées par les abeilles et autres insectes. Xylocopa (Hyménoptères) sont très pollinifères. Les fourmis visitent les nectars extrafloraux et contribuent au succès de la croissance de la reproduction dans certaines zones. Les feuilles et les graines contiennent de l'ergotamine, alkaloïde indol qui les protège contre de nombreux herbivores. Les fleurs sont parfois mangées par les herbivores et un coléoptère (Megacerus leucospilus) parasite les graines.},

	abstract = {The use of some multiple-sequence alignments in phylogenetic analysis, particularly those that are not very well conserved, requires the elimination of poorly aligned positions and divergent regions, since they may not be homologous or may have been saturated by multiple substitutions. A computerized method that eliminates such positions and at the same time tries to minimize the loss of informative sites is presented here. The method is based on the selection of blocks of positions that fulfill a simple set of requirements with respect to the number of contiguous conserved positions, lack of gaps, and high conservation of flanking positions, making the final alignment more suitable for phylogenetic analysis. To illustrate the efficiency of this method, alignments of 10 mitochondrial proteins from several completely sequenced mitochondrial genomes belonging to diverse eukaryotes were used as examples. The percentages of removed positions were higher in the most divergent alignments. After removing divergent segments, the amino acid composition of the different sequences was more uniform, and pairwise distances became much smaller. Phylogenetic trees show that topologies can be different after removing conserved blocks, particularly when there are several poorly resolved nodes. Strong support was found for the grouping of animals and fungi but not for the position of more basal eukaryotes. The use of a computerized method such as the one presented here reduces to a certain extent the necessity of manually editing multiple alignments, makes the automation of phylogenetic analysis of large data sets feasible, and facilitates the reproduction of the final alignment by other researchers.},

We compiled the checklist using the results from herbarium records, literature citations, online resources and a Rapid Botanic Survey (RBS) of 240 sample plots across the islands. From the RBS plots 22,500 vascular plant specimens were collected, yielding 1530 species. The herbarium records, literature citations and the RBS plots yielded a total of 3639 species, of which 2407 are indigenous, 1222 are exotic and 108 are endemic or near endemic. The low endemism is attributed to the islands’ close proximity to and recent separation from the South American continent. A total of 262 species of grasses (Poaceae) is published here for the first time along with the results from the RBS plots. Our annotated checklist further presents two types of conservation rating: the International Union for the Conservation of Nature Red List Categories and a global Star rating system. Based on the clustering of the ‘Star rating’ of each species, plant communities in the following areas: the Heights of Aripo, parts of the Nariva Swamp and the North-west Islands were identified as ‘hot spots’ of high conservation value which should continue to, or receive greater protection in the National Parks and Protected Areas system established in Trinidad and Tobago.},

A combination of general walk-over surveys and plotless landscape sampling for plant collection and sight observation was used. We recorded 628 plant species representing 118 families and 392 genera, which almost double the latest results of the previous most recent survey. We found 61 species of ferns and fern allies and 567 species of seed plants, representing 9.98\% of the total plant species in Kenya. Herbs were the majority (50.2\%) of life forms followed by shrubs (16.5\%). We report unique populations of three species out of 19 species that are widespread in Africa, but restricted to Nandi and Kakamega Forests in Kenya. Four of the recorded species are threatened globally and 16 exotic plant species were found. The recent description of one new species and two new records for Kenya from these forests, together with the comprehensive checklist is of crucial importance to the conservation of these unique ecosystems. Our results are essential to forest managers, community forest associations, conservationists, students and research scientists in Kenya and globally for implementing critical decisions for the conservation of this vital biodiversity resource.},

	abstract = {Abstract We tested the phylogenetic hypothesis that the circumscription of the genus Ipomoea comprises all members of Hallier's historical taxon, subfamily “Echinoconiae”, including Argyreia, Astripomoea, Lepistemon, Rivea, Stictocardia, and Turbina. Support for the paraphyly of Ipomoea was found based on phylogenetic analysis of 45 taxa using DNA sequences (the ITS region and three exons and two introns of the 3’ end of the nuclear gene waxy) in combination with morphological data. Two major clades within Ipomoea s. l. were resolved in the strict consensus of 16 most parsimonious trees. One clade included most of the smaller segregate genera interspersed with species of Ipomoea, whereas the other was formed by Ipomoea s.s. and Astripomoea. Our results also indicated the genus Turbina is polyphyletic and Rivea is nested within Argyreia. Together, these results suggest new phylogenetic interpretations and point towards a revised view of the nature of morphological evolution among these taxa. We used both our current understanding of morning glory systematics and the distribution of character state variation in seven taxonomically important characters to demonstrate that: 1) the common Ipomoea form is widely distributed, 2) the common form has given rise to specialized forms exhibiting a diversity of character state combinations, and 3) many of the specialized forms have arisen repeatedly. On the basis of these observations, we forward a general model of mosaic evolution that emphasizes extreme evolutionary lability in morphology among morning glory species.

	abstract = {Recent debate about the development of complex societies on the north coast of Peru has turned on the relative importance of marine vs. terrestrial resources and the extent to which different resource zones are upset by El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. While ENSO events are cited frequently as having important consequences for Prehispanic Andean societies, in fact there are few archaeological data about the nature of cultural responses to a specific ENSO event. Archaeological data from two Chimu settlements in the Casma Valley, Peru—Quebrada Sta. Cristina and Manchan—document the occurrence of a fourteenth-century A.D. ENSO event and some of the cultural responses to that prehistoric El Niño.
          , 
            Un aspecto del debate sobre el desarollo de sociedades costeñas en el Perú prehispánico ha llamado atención al papel relativo de los recursos marinos vs. los recursos terestres y los efectos episódicos de los cambios ambientales de “El Niño.” Mientras que varios arqueólogos han planteado hipótesis sobre los “Niños” prehispánicos y las sociedades andinas, escasos son los datos arqueológicos sobre las reacciones culturales al fenómeno “El Niño.” Datos de dos sitios chimu del valle de Casma, Quebrada Sta. Cristina y Manchan, indican el caso de un “El Niño” que occurió durante el siglo XIV (D.C.) y las respuestas sociales a este fenómeno prehispánico.
            
              Parece que los restos moluscos de los dos sitios representan los efectos de un “El Niño” en el siglo XIV. En el sitio de Quebrada Sta. Cristina hay una ausencia de choros—como
              Aulacomya ater, Semimytilius alzozus
              y
              Brachidontes purpuratus
              —clases de mariscos bien representados en el sitio de Manchan. La ausencia de choros en Quebrada Sta. Cristina no fue el resultado de una falta de acceso a recursos marinos porque la Quebrada Sta. Cristina está más cerca al mar que Manchan y, además, hay restos de otros moluscos como chiton (
              Chiton
              spp.) que viven, usualmente, con los choros en las piedras y las olas de la costa peruana. La ausencia de los choros en el sitio de Quebrada Sta. Cristina nos sugiere un cambio ambiental de un “El Niño.”
            
            Además, el sitio de Quebrada Sta. Cristina está asociado a un conjunto de campos elevados en el valle de Casma, los únicos campos elevados conocidos de la costa peruana. Plantea la hipótesis que los campos elevados fueron construidos por los habitantes del sitio de Quebrada Sta. Cristina y que la comunidad prehispánica y los campos elevados fueron organizados por el estado chimu. El sitio fue un campamento de trabajadores estatales quienes construyeron los campos elevados, y éstos fueron un proyecto para reestablecer la producción agrícola del valle de Casma destruida por los efectos de un “El Niño” del siglo XIV.
            Finalmente, los datos del valle de Casma nos sugieren la necesidad de obtener datos más precisos sobre las fechas, la intensidad y la duración de los cambios ambientales asociados con “El Niño.” Sólo con esos datos será posible delinear las relaciones entre el medio ambiente andino y el desarrollo prehispánico de las sociedades peruanas.},

Field samples and herbarium collections were analyzed to build a list of species, indicating the most representative taxa and providing data on growth habit, geographic distribution, occurrence in Brazilian phytogeographic domains, and distribution in the Upper Turi-Gurupi region. Twenty-one species and nine genera (Aniseia Choisy, Bonamia Thouars, Camonea Raf., Distimake Raf., Evolvulus L., Ipomoea L., Maripa Aubl., Odonellia K.R. Robertson, and Operculina Silva Manso) were recorded. Ipomoea was the most representative genus, with 10 species, and Ipomoea asarifolia was the most collected species. Maripa scandens Aubl. is a new record for the state of Maranhão and in relation to the last taxonomic work of Convolvulaceae in the Amazon, which covered Maranhão, 10 species are new records for the state. A heterogeneous distribution of the species and sampling gaps of Convolvulaceae were observed in the region, pointing to the need for further surveys. This study contributes to the knowledge of this botanical family in the Amazon territory and stimulates the conservation of the Amazonian flora in Maranhão, since the study area is under strong pressure from environmental degradation and is one of the most threatened in terms of biodiversity loss in the Amazon.},

	abstract = {The morning glories (Convolvulaceae) are distributed worldwide and produce economically important crops, medicinal herbs, and ornamentals. Members of this family are diverse in morphological characteristics and trophic modes, including the leafless parasitic Cuscuta (dodders). Organelle genomes were generally used for studying plant phylogeny and genomic variations. Notably, plastomes in parasitic plants always show non-canonical features, such as reduced size and accelerated rates. However, few organelle genomes of this group have been sequenced, hindering our understanding of their evolution, and dodder mitogenome in particular.
We assembled 22 new mitogenomes and 12 new plastomes in Convolvulaceae. Alongside previously known ones, we totally analyzed organelle genomes of 23 species in the family. Our sampling includes 16 leafy autotrophic species and 7 leafless parasitic dodders, covering 8 of the 12 tribes. Both the plastid and mitochondrial genomes of these plants have encountered variations that were rarely observed in other angiosperms. All of the plastomes possessed atypical IR boundaries. Besides the gene and IR losses in dodders, some leafy species also showed gene and intron losses, duplications, structural variations, and insertions of foreign DNAs. The phylogeny reconstructed by plastid protein coding sequences confirmed the previous relationship of the tribes. However, the monophyly of ‘Merremieae’ and the sister group of Cuscuta remained uncertain. The mitogenome was significantly inflated in Cuscuta japonica, which has exceeded over 800 kb and integrated massive DNAs from other species. In other dodders, mitogenomes were maintained in small size, revealing divergent evolutionary strategies. Mutations unique to plants were detected in the mitochondrial gene ccmFc, which has broken into three fragments through gene fission and splicing shift. The unusual changes likely initially happened to the common ancestor of the family and were caused by a foreign insertion from rosids followed by double-strand breaks and imprecise DNA repairs. The coding regions of ccmFc expanded at both sides after the fission, which may have altered the protein structure.
Our family-scale analyses uncovered unusual scenarios for both organelle genomes in Convolvulaceae, especially in parasitic plants. The data provided valuable genetic resources for studying the evolution of Convolvulaceae and plant parasitism.},

We also discuss sweet potato presence on the island and provide biological information relevant to the study of sweet potato archaeological remains.

In this work, we identified a total of 37 expansins (ItrEXPs) in our previously reported SR-forming I. trifida strain Y22 genome, which included 23 ItrEXPAs, 4 ItrEXPBs, 2 ItrEXLAs and 8 ItrEXLBs. The phylogenetic relationship, genome localization, subcellular localization, gene and protein structure, promoter cis-regulating elements, and protein interaction network were systematically analyzed to reveal the possible roles of ItrEXPs in the SR development of I. trifida. The gene expression profiling in Y22 SR development revealed that ItrEXPAs and ItrEXLBs were down-regulated, and ItrEXPBs were up-regulated while ItrEXLAs were not obviously changed during the critical period of SR expansion, and might be beneficial to SR development. Combining the tissue-specific expression in young SR transverse sections of Y22 and sweetpotato tissue, we deduced that ItrEXLB05, ItrEXLB07 and ItrEXLB08 might be the key genes for initial SR formation and enlargement, and ItrEXLA02 might be the key gene for root growth and development. This work provides new insights into the functions of the expansin gene family members in I. trifida, especially for EXLA and EXLB subfamilies genes in SR development.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          
            Sweetpotato [
            Ipomoea batatas
            (L.) Lam.] is one of the most important crops in many developing countries and provides a candidate source of bioenergy. However, neither high-quality reference genome nor large-scale full-length cDNA sequences for this outcrossing hexaploid are still lacking, which in turn impedes progress in research studies in sweetpotato functional genomics and molecular breeding. In this study, we apply a combination of second- and third-generation sequencing technologies to sequence full-length transcriptomes in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor
            I. trifida
            . In total, we obtained 53,861/51,184 high-quality transcripts, which includes 34,963/33,637 putative full-length cDNA sequences, from sweetpotato/
            I. trifida
            . Amongst, we identified 104,540/94,174 open reading frames, 1476/1475 transcription factors, 25,315/27,090 simple sequence repeats, 417/531 long non-coding RNAs out of the sweetpotato/
            I. trifida
            dataset. By utilizing public available genomic contigs, we analyzed the gene features (including exon number, exon size, intron number, intron size, exon-intron structure) of 33,119 and 32,793 full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and
            I. trifida
            , respectively. Furthermore, comparative analysis between our transcript datasets and other large-scale cDNA datasets from different plant species enables us assessing the quality of public datasets, estimating the genetic similarity across relative species, and surveyed the evolutionary pattern of genes. Overall, our study provided fundamental resources of large-scale full-length transcripts in sweetpotato and its putative ancestor, for the first time, and would facilitate structural, functional and comparative genomics studies in this important crop.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          Concurrent molecular dating of population and species divergences is essential in many biological investigations, including phylogeography, phylodynamics, and species delimitation studies. Multiple sequence alignments used in these investigations frequently consist of both intra- and inter-species samples (mixed samples). As a result, the phylogenetic trees contain inter-species, inter-population, and within population divergences. To date these sequence divergences, Bayesian relaxed clock methods are often employed, but they assume the same tree prior for both inter- and intra-species branching processes and require specification of a clock model for branch rates (independent vs. autocorrelated rates models). We evaluated the impact of using the same tree prior on the Bayesian divergence time estimates by analyzing computer-simulated datasets. We also examined the effect of the assumption of independence of evolutionary rate variation among branches when the branch rates are autocorrelated. Bayesian approach with Skyline-coalescent tree priors generally produced excellent molecular dates, with some tree priors (e.g., Yule) performing the best when evolutionary rates were autocorrelated, and lineage sorting was incomplete. We compared the performance of the Bayesian approach with a non-Bayesian, the RelTime method, which does not require specification of a tree prior or selection of a clock model. We found that RelTime performed as well as the Bayesian approach, and when the clock model was mis-specified, RelTime performed slightly better. These results suggest that the computationally efficient RelTime approach is also suitable to analyze datasets containing both populations and species variation.},

	abstract = {We investigate the shape of a phylogenetic tree reconstructed from sequences evolving under the coalescent with recombination. The motivation is that evolutionary inferences are often made from phylogenetic trees reconstructed from population data even though recombination may well occur (mtDNA or viral sequences) or does occur (nuclear sequences). We investigate the size and direction of biases when a single tree is reconstructed ignoring recombination. Standard software (PHYLIP) was used to construct the best phylogenetic tree from sequences simulated under the coalescent with recombination. With recombination present, the length of terminal branches and the total branch length are larger, and the time to the most recent common ancestor smaller, than for a tree reconstructed from sequences evolving with no recombination. The effects are pronounced even for small levels of recombination that may not be immediately detectable in a data set. The phylogenies when recombination is present superficially resemble phylogenies for sequences from an exponentially growing population. However, exponential growth has a different effect on statistics such as Tajima's D. Furthermore, ignoring recombination leads to a large overestimation of the substitution rate heterogeneity and the loss of the molecular clock. These results are discussed in relation to viral and mtDNA data sets.},

We used lexical data and Bayesian phylogenetic methods to construct a phylogeny of 400 languages. In agreement with the pulse-pause scenario, the language trees place the Austronesian origin in Taiwan approximately 5230 years ago and reveal a series of settlement pauses and expansion pulses linked to technological and social innovations. These results are robust to assumptions about the rooting and calibration of the trees and demonstrate the combined power of linguistic scholarship, database technologies, and computational phylogenetic methods for resolving questions about human prehistory.},

The current Nazca, Cocos and Juan de Fuca (Gorda) plates were initially one plate, produced to the east of the original spreading centre before becoming split into three. The islands of the Pacific have originated as: linear chains of volcanic islands on the above plates either by mantle plume or propagating fracture origin, atolls, uplifted coralline reefs, fragments of continental crust, obducted portions of adjoining lithospheric plates and islands resulting from subduction along convergent plate margins. Out of the 11 linear volcanic chains identified, each is briefly described and its history summarized.

              There is no direct evidence of the effect of lignin metabolism on early storage root development in sweet potato. In this study, we found that heterologous expression of the maize leaf color (
              Lc
              ) gene in sweet potato increased anthocyanin pigment accumulation in the whole plant and resulted in reduced size with an increased length/width ratio, low yield and less starch content in the early storage roots. RT-PCR analysis revealed dramatic up-regulation of the genes involved in the lignin biosynthesis pathway in developing storage roots, leading to greater lignin content in the
              Lc
              transgenic lines, compared to the wild type. This was also evidenced by the enhanced lignification of vascular cells in the early storage roots. Furthermore, increased expression of the β-amylase gene in leaves and storage roots also accelerated starch degradation and increased the sugar use efficiency, providing more energy and carbohydrate sources for lignin biosynthesis in the
              Lc
              transgenic sweet potato. Lesser starch accumulation was observed in the developing storage roots at the initiation stage in the Lc plants. Our study provides experimental evidence of the basic carbohydrate metabolism underlying the development of storage roots, which is the transformation of lignin biosynthesis to starch biosynthesis.},

In this chapter we explore the interrelationships between these three properties in the context of cryptic taxa, here defined as a clade with no obvious diagnostic morphological support. We present the view that the number of nodes on a phylogenetic tree of all flowering plants that have morphological diagnostic support is less than five percent; as such, cryptic nodes are much more common than non-cryptic nodes. Because of this, we suggest that the phrase ‘cryptic nodes’ is a preferable description as opposed to cryptic taxa because taxa in the sense of traditional classifications are generally diagnostic. By reference to a global taxonomic study of the genus Ipomoea, we discuss the role of diagnosability at various scales including major infrageneric clade, genus and species. We demonstrate that the level of diagnosability for Ipomoea is relatively low, therefore making cryptic nodes the rule and not the exception. We provide several examples of such cryptic nodes, detail how we discovered them and place them in a wider conceptual framework of diagnosability in angiosperms.},

In a transfer and adaptation model, crop stores if not seasonal production technologies also were introduced from a warmer, agricultural Aotearoa region into dune microclimates of 15th-century coastal Otago to mitigate megafaunal loss, and perhaps to support Polynesia’s southernmost residential chiefdom in its earliest phase.

	abstract = {The amount of data used in phylogenetics has grown explosively in the recent years and many phylogenies are inferred with hundreds or even thousands of loci and many taxa. These modern phylogenomic studies often entail separate analyses of each of the loci in addition to multiple analyses of subsets of genes or concatenated sequences. Computationally efficient tools for handling and computing properties of thousands of single-locus or large concatenated alignments are needed. Here I present AMAS (Alignment Manipulation And Summary), a tool that can be used either as a stand-alone command-line utility or as a Python package. AMAS works on amino acid and nucleotide alignments and combines capabilities of sequence manipulation with a function that calculates basic statistics. The manipulation functions include conversions among popular formats, concatenation, extracting sites and splitting according to a pre-defined partitioning scheme, creation of replicate data sets, and removal of taxa. The statistics calculated include the number of taxa, alignment length, total count of matrix cells, overall number of undetermined characters, percent of missing data, AT and GC contents (for DNA alignments), count and proportion of variable sites, count and proportion of parsimony informative sites, and counts of all characters relevant for a nucleotide or amino acid alphabet. AMAS is particularly suitable for very large alignments with hundreds of taxa and thousands of loci. It is computationally efficient, utilizes parallel processing, and performs better at concatenation than other popular tools. AMAS is a Python 3 program that relies solely on Python’s core modules and needs no additional dependencies. AMAS source code and manual can be downloaded from

            Polyploidy is an important generator of evolutionary novelty across diverse groups in the Tree of Life, including many crops. However, the impact of whole-genome duplication (WGD) depends on the mode of formation: doubling within a single lineage (autopolyploidy) versus doubling after hybridization between two different lineages (allopolyploidy). Researchers have historically treated these two scenarios as completely separate cases based on patterns of chromosome pairing, but these cases represent ideals on a continuum of chromosomal interactions among duplicated genomes. Understanding the history of polyploid species thus demands quantitative inferences of demographic history and rates of exchange between subgenomes. To meet this need, we developed diffusion models for genetic variation in polyploids with subgenomes that cannot be bioinformatically separated and with potentially variable inheritance patterns, implementing them in the dadi software. We validated our models using forward SLiM simulations and found that our inference approach is able to accurately infer evolutionary parameters (timing, bottleneck size) involved with the formation of auto- and allotetraploids, as well as exchange rates in segmental allotetraploids. We then applied our models to empirical data for allotetraploid shepherd’s purse (
            Capsella bursa-pastoris
            ), finding evidence for allelic exchange between the subgenomes. Taken together, our model provides a foundation for demographic modeling in polyploids using diffusion equations, which will help increase our understanding of the impact of demography and selection in polyploid lineages.},

	doi = {10.1126/science.1236828},
	abstract = {Integration of evidence over the past decade has revised understandings about the major adaptations underlying the origin and early evolution of the genus Homo. Many features associated with Homo sapiens, including our large linear bodies, elongated hind limbs, large energy-expensive brains, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits, were once thought to have evolved near the origin of the genus in response to heightened aridity and open habitats in Africa. However, recent analyses of fossil, archaeological, and environmental data indicate that such traits did not arise as a single package. Instead, some arose substantially earlier and some later than previously thought. From {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.5 to 1.5 million years ago, three lineages of early Homo evolved in a context of habitat instability and fragmentation on seasonal, intergenerational, and evolutionary time scales. These contexts gave a selective advantage to traits, such as dietary flexibility and larger body size, that facilitated survival in shifting environments. Background Until recently, the evolution of the genus Homo has been interpreted in the context of the onset of African aridity and the expansion of open grasslands. Homo erectus was considered to be a bona fide member of the genus Homo, but opinions diverged on the generic status of earlier, more fragmentary fossils traditionally attributed to Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis. Arguments about generic status of these taxa rested on inferred similarities and differences in adaptive plateau. However, there was near-universal agreement that the open-country suite of features inferred for Homo erectus had evolved together and provided the adaptations for dispersal beyond Africa. These features foreshadowed those of more recent Homo sapiens and included large, linear bodies, elongated legs, large brain sizes, reduced sexual dimorphism, increased carnivory, and unique life history traits (e.g., extended ontogeny and longevity) as well as toolmaking and increased social cooperation. Hominin evolution from 3.0 to 1.5 Ma. (Species) Currently known species temporal ranges for Pa, Paranthropus aethiopicus; Pb, P. boisei; Pr, P. robustus; A afr, Australopithecus africanus; Ag, A. garhi; As, A. sediba; H sp., early Homo {\textbackslash}textgreater2.1 million years ago (Ma); 1470 group and 1813 group representing a new interpretation of the traditionally recognized H. habilis and H. rudolfensis; and He, H. erectus. He (D) indicates H. erectus from Dmanisi. (Behavior) Icons indicate from the bottom the first appearance of stone tools (the Oldowan technology) at {\textbackslash}textasciitilde2.6 Ma, the dispersal of Homo to Eurasia at {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.85 Ma, and the appearance of the Acheulean technology at {\textbackslash}textasciitilde1.76 Ma. The number of contemporaneous hominin taxa during this period reflects different strategies of adaptation to habitat variability. The cultural milestones do not correlate with the known first appearances of any of the currently recognized Homo taxa. Advances Over the past decade, new fossil discoveries and new lines of interpretation have substantially altered this interpretation. New environmental data sets suggest that Homo evolved against a background of long periods of habitat unpredictability that were superimposed on the underlying aridity trend. New fossils support the presence of multiple groups of early Homo that overlap in body, brain, and tooth size and challenge the traditional interpretation of H. habilis and H. rudolfensis as representing small and large morphs, respectively. Because of a fragmentary and distorted type specimen for H. habilis two informal morphs are proposed, the 1813 group and the 1470 group, that are distinguished on the basis of facial anatomy but do not contain the same constituent fossils as the more formally designated species of early Homo. Furthermore, traits once thought to define early Homo, particularly H. erectus, did not arise as a single package. Some features once considered characteristic of Homo are found in Australopithecus (e.g., long hind limbs), whereas others do not occur until much later in time (e.g., narrow pelves and extended ontogeny). When integrated with our understanding of the biology of living humans and other mammals, the fossil and archaeological record of early Homo suggests that key factors to the success and expansion of the genus rested on dietary flexibility in unpredictable environments, which, along with cooperative breeding and flexibility in development, allowed range expansion and reduced mortality risks. Outlook Although more fossils and archaeological finds will continue to enhance our understanding of the evolution of early Homo, the comparative biology of mammals (including humans) will continue to provide valuable frameworks for the interpretation of existing material. This comparative context enables us to formulate and test robust models of the relationships between energetics, life history, brain and body size, diet, mortality, and resource variability and thereby yield a deeper understanding of human evolution.},

            Recent reports have identified differences in the mutational spectra across human populations. Although some of these reports have been replicated in other cohorts, most have been reported only in the 1000 Genomes Project (1kGP) data. While investigating an intriguing putative population stratification within the Japanese population, we identified a previously unreported batch effect leading to spurious mutation calls in the 1kGP data and to the apparent population stratification. Because the 1kGP data are used extensively, we find that the batch effects also lead to incorrect imputation by leading imputation servers and a small number of suspicious GWAS associations. Lower quality data from the early phases of the 1kGP thus continue to contaminate modern studies in hidden ways. It may be time to retire or upgrade such legacy sequencing data.},

              We present several recent improvements to minimap2, a versatile pairwise aligner for nucleotide sequences. Now minimap2 v2.22 can more accurately map long reads to highly repetitive regions and align through insertions or deletions up to 100 kb by default, addressing major weakness in minimap2 v2.18 or earlier.

Two species in Solanum section Juglandifolia, distributed in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru, are sister to section Lycopersicon, and two species of Solanum section Lycopersicoides, distributed in southern Peru and northern Chile, are sister to sections Lycopersicon and Juglandifolia. The delimitation and relationships of wild tomatoes have differed widely depending upon whether morphological or biological species concepts are considered more important. Our monograph summarizes recent morphological and molecular studies of section Lycopersicon, section Juglandifolia, and section Lycopersicoides, and utilizes data from herbarium specimens and observations of germplasm accessions of all species grown in gardens. We recognize four species from the previously polymorphic S. peruvianum sensu lato: S. arcanum, S. corneliomulleri, S. huaylasense, and S. peruvianum sensu stricto, and recognize section Lycopersicoides at sectional level for the first time. Full descriptions and synonymies (including designations of lectotypes), illustrations, distribution maps, and an extensive list of localities are provided for all of tomato and outgroup species.},

In this paper the monophyly of this genus is tested using a molecular phylogeny based on three plastid (ndhF, matK, rbcL) and a single nuclear (PHYC) markers that were newly sequenced for the three currently accepted species in this genus, along with representative taxa from the main phylogenetic groups previously recognized in Malpighiaceae. The three species of Lasiocarpus were retrieved in a well supported clade corroborating the monophyly of this genus. A taxonomic treatment of this genus is presented. Lasiocarpus ovalifolius is synonymized with L. salicifolius, and a new species, Lasiocarpus andersoniorum , endemic to Southern Mexico, is proposed. It is morphologically distinguished by characters such as axillary inflorescences, reflexed sepals, petals with crenate margin and strigose indumentum, large styles, and 2-lobed stigmas. The taxonomic revision includes morphological descriptions and distribution maps for the three accepted species of Lasiocarpus.},

The stronghold for species diversity is the state of Minas Gerais with 36 species, 30 of which are endemic there. This study represents the first comprehensive monograph of the genus based on field work across its distributional range, complemented by examination of over 3620 specimens from 35 herbaria. An evaluation of taxonomic characters used in the long-standing sectional classification of the genus has led to its abandonment because it is based on artificial characters and does not provide a sound working hypothesis of infrageneric relationships. Eight new species are described: L. arachnoidea, L. belinelloi, L. canastrensis, L. daviesiana, L. minima, L. rundeliana, L. setosa, and L. vestita; lectotypifications are provided for L. caryophyllea, L. chamaepitys, L. glandulifera, L. pulchella, and L. senae; and 44 epithets are relegated to synonymy. An identification key, full synonymy, descriptions, habitat and phenological information, distribution maps, diagnostic illustrations, images of representative species in the field, and geospatial conservation assessments are provided for all species based on IUCN criteria. SEM images of seed morphology are presented for nearly half of the species along with camera lucida drawings of meiotic chromosome figures for selected species, and an index to numbered collections examined.},

The genus is distinguished based on the membranous leaves, usually sparsely pubescent with eglandular simple trichomes, pseudo-verticillate leaf arrangement, and elongated, pendulous, and few-flowered inflorescences with showy flowers and conical fruits. Three new combinations are made to transfer species to the new genus previously described as part of the polyphyletic genus

              A.Orejuela \& Villanueva,
              sp. nov.

              (Cariceae, Cyperaceae) is endemic to the Afrotropical biogeographic region and is mainly distributed in southern and eastern Africa, with its center of diversity in eastern South Africa. The taxon was formerly recognized as a distinct genus and has a long history of taxonomic controversy. It has also an important morphological and molecular background in particular dealing with the complexity of its inflorescence and the phylogenetic relationships of its species. We here present a fully updated and integrative monograph of
              Carex

              based on morphological, molecular and cytogenetic data. A total of 1,017 herbarium specimens were examined and the majority of the species were studied in the field. Previous molecular phylogenies based on Sanger-sequencing of four nuclear and plastid DNA regions and RAD-seq were expanded. For the first time, chromosome numbers were obtained, with cytogenetic counts on 44 populations from 15 species and one hybrid. Our taxonomic treatment recognizes 21 species, one of them herein newly described (
              C. gordon-grayae

Although whale bones are found at the site, they are rare and fragmentary; the relatively robust shells of Coronula are thus a useful proxy for establishing ancient cetacean migration routes.},

              Chthamalus
              are commonly encountered rocky intertidal shores. The phylogeography of the different species in the Western Indian Ocean is unclear. Using morphological characteristics as well as the molecular markers mitochondrial cytochrome oxygenase subunit I (COI) and the nuclear sodium-potassium ATPase (NaKA), we identified four clades representing four species in the Western Indian Ocean and its adjacent seas. Among these species, a newly identified species,
              Chthamalus barilani
              , which was found in Madagascar, Zanzibar and Tanzania.
              Chthamalus
              from the coasts of Tanzania and Zanzibar is identified morphologically as
              C. malayensis
              , and clusters with
              C. malayensis
              from the Western Pacific and the Indo Malayan regions.
              C. malayensis
              is regarded as a group of four genetically differentiated clades representing four cryptic species. The newly identified African clade is genetically different from these clades and the pairwise distances between them justify the conclusion that it is an additional cryptic species of
              C. malayensis
              . This type of genetic analyses offers an advantage over morphological characterization and allowed us to reveal that another species,
              C. barnesi
              , which is known from the Red Sea, is also distributed in the Arabian Sea and the Persian Gulf. We could also confirm the presence of the South African species
              C. dentatus
              in the Mozambique channel. This represents the Northeastern limit of
              C. dentatus
              , which is usually distributed along the coast of southern Africa up to the Islands of Cape Verde in West Africa. Altogether, based on a combination of morphology and genetics, we distinct between four clusters of
              Chthamalus
              , and designate their distribution in the West Indian Ocean. These distinctions do not agree with the traditional four groups reported previously based merely on morphological data. Furthermore, these findings underline the importance of a combining morphological and genetics tools for constructing barnacle taxonomy.},

Purpose of the review: The core objective of this appraisal is to emphasize the different characteristics of Saqmunia (Convolvulus scammonia L.) viz. botanical description, pharmacological and therapeutic properties, folklore uses, temperament, dose, scientific studies, etc, as mentioned in Unani and botanical literature that will be helpful in the rationale use of this botanical drug. 
Materials and methods: This review was done after going through ample of literature survey of Unani and botanical texts, and published articles related to Saqmunia (Convolvulus scammonia L.). The botanical names of drugs mentioned in this review have been validated through ‘World Flora’ (http://www.worldfloraonline.org). 
Results: The Unani physicians prescribe Saqmunia for the treatment of skin diseases, chronic headache, bilious fever, conjunctivitis, jaundice, etc. This drug is also added in many compound Unani formulations such as Habb-i-Kotwali, Safoof-i-Suranjan, Habb-i-Banafsha, Ayarij-i-Kabir, Tiryaq-i-Zahab, Habb-i-Saqmunia, Majun-i-Anjeer, etc which are used for various therapeutic purposes. The phytochemical analysis of the root of Convolvulus scammonia L. has been reported that it contains 8\% resin along with beta-methyl-esculetin, dihydroxy cinnamic acid, ipuranol, sucrose, reducing sugar, starch, etc. The resin yields glycosides mainly scamonin which is pharmacologically active. Some scientific reports showed that this important medicinal plant possesses certain potential pharmacological activities. The significant anticancer property of aqueous and alkaline extracts of Convolvulus scammonia L. has been identified in mice. 
Conclusion: Although, the resin of Convolvulus scammonia L. is extensively used in Unani medicine. But, sufficient studies regarding its pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, pharmacology and toxicology are still lacking. Hence, it is suggested that extensive studies by using modern scientific parameters may be carried out to explore the every aspect of this important botanical drug.

This study compares the efficiency of three modified methodologies for DNA extraction of six sweetpotato landraces using the CTAB extraction buffer in regard to quantity and purity of DNA quantification and microsatellite band patterns. All methodologies yielded satisfactory results, but the method based in leaf tissue macerated in liquid nitrogen was deemed more adequate because of its simplicity and lower cost. However, the method based in dry leaf tissue was considered more advantageous, first because elicits practicability in the plant acquisition and drying process, especially when the collection is performed in situ, and also because its simplicity makes possible the cold storage of the dry, ground samples for future DNA extractions.},

	abstract = {Acalypha (Euphorbiaceae: Acalyphoideae) is a large, monophyletic genus distributed worldwide in tropical and subtropical regions, with a few species extending into temperate areas of southern Africa, Asia, and North and South America. We reconstructed phylogenetic relationships within the genus using DNA sequences from the plastid ndhF and trnL-F regions and the nuclear ribosomal ITS region, sampling 142 species to represent the geographic, morphologic, and taxonomic diversity with the genus, resulting in a 162 (158 in Acalypha) terminal and 3847 character combined dataset. Bayesian and maximum likelihood reconstructions based on the combined dataset yielded a tree with a generally well-supported backbone and several strongly supported clades. Our results strongly supported the monophyly of Acalypha subg. Acalypha as currently recognized but showed that A. subg. Linostachys and almost all other infrageneric taxa recognized in the most recent comprehensive classification of the genus were not monophyletic. We therefore propose a new subgeneric classification comprising A. subg. Acalypha, A. subg. Androcephala, A. subg. Hypandrae, and A. subg. Linostachys (s.s.). Our results also shed light on relationships within some species groups, including in what has been treated as a broadly defined A. amentacea, in which we recognize A. amentacea, A. palauensis comb. nov., and A. wilkesiana as distinct species. Bayesian ancestral state estimations based on the phylogeny of Acalypha demonstrated that inflorescence position and sexuality and habit show high homoplasy, especially within A. subg. Acalypha, and that inflorescence position and habit exhibit correlated evolution.},

            Tree diversity is fundamental for forest ecosystem stability and services. However, because of limited available data, estimates of tree diversity at large geographic domains still rely heavily on published lists of species descriptions that are geographically uneven in coverage. These limitations have precluded efforts to generate a global perspective. Here, based on a ground-sourced global database, we estimate the number of tree species at biome, continental, and global scales. We estimated a global tree richness (≈73,300) that is ≈14\% higher than numbers known today, with most undiscovered species being rare, continentally endemic, and tropical or subtropical. These results highlight the vulnerability of global tree species diversity to anthropogenic changes.
          , 
            One of the most fundamental questions in ecology is how many species inhabit the Earth. However, due to massive logistical and financial challenges and taxonomic difficulties connected to the species concept definition, the global numbers of species, including those of important and well-studied life forms such as trees, still remain largely unknown. Here, based on global ground-sourced data, we estimate the total tree species richness at global, continental, and biome levels. Our results indicate that there are ∼73,000 tree species globally, among which ∼9,000 tree species are yet to be discovered. Roughly 40\% of undiscovered tree species are in South America. Moreover, almost one-third of all tree species to be discovered may be rare, with very low populations and limited spatial distribution (likely in remote tropical lowlands and mountains). These findings highlight the vulnerability of global forest biodiversity to anthropogenic changes in land use and climate, which disproportionately threaten rare species and thus, global tree richness.},

Fossil pollen is found worldwide, with the oldest occurrence being Calystegiapollis microechinatus from the early Eocene of Africa. Perfotricolpites digitatus first appears in the mid-Eocene of Brazil, and specimens similar to P. digitatus from Antarctica suggest that it migrated into   Australia by the Antarctic route.

Morphological and cytological observations were carried out using newly introduced Ipomoea species from tropical America en 1979 and 1980. Diploids, tetraploids and hexaploids were recognized by studying the somatic chromosome numbers. It was impossible to detect accurately the ploidy level only on the basis of the morphological characteristics. Most diploid plants of the complex bear no tuberous roots but some accesions produce somewhat thickened roots. This thickness of roots strongly suggests that diploid forms have the potential to produce tuberous roots.},

With this we can add 67 species newly recorded for Angola, including two new generic records and five alien species, to the almost 7,300 vascular plant taxa known so far for Angola. Most of the new records for Angola are also present in different neighbouring countries, but they are little known, and their IUCN threat status has not been assessed yet.

	abstract = {Abstract
            The tree of life is the fundamental biological roadmap for navigating the evolution and properties of life on Earth, and yet remains largely unknown. Even angiosperms (flowering plants) are fraught with data gaps, despite their critical role in sustaining terrestrial life. Today, high-throughput sequencing promises to significantly deepen our understanding of evolutionary relationships. Here, we describe a comprehensive phylogenomic platform for exploring the angiosperm tree of life, comprising a set of open tools and data based on the 353 nuclear genes targeted by the universal Angiosperms353 sequence capture probes. The primary goals of this article are to (i) document our methods, (ii) describe our first data release, and (iii) present a novel open data portal, the Kew Tree of Life Explorer (https://treeoflife.kew.org). We aim to generate novel target sequence capture data for all genera of flowering plants, exploiting natural history collections such as herbarium specimens, and augment it with mined public data. Our first data release, described here, is the most extensive nuclear phylogenomic data set for angiosperms to date, comprising 3099 samples validated by DNA barcode and phylogenetic tests, representing all 64 orders, 404 families (96\${\textbackslash}\%\$) and 2333 genera (17\${\textbackslash}\%\$). A “first pass” angiosperm tree of life was inferred from the data, which totaled 824,878 sequences, 489,086,049 base pairs, and 532,260 alignment columns, for interactive presentation in the Kew Tree of Life Explorer. This species tree was generated using methods that were rigorous, yet tractable at our scale of operation. Despite limitations pertaining to taxon and gene sampling, gene recovery, models of sequence evolution and paralogy, the tree strongly supports existing taxonomy, while challenging numerous hypothesized relationships among orders and placing many genera for the first time. The validated data set, species tree and all intermediates are openly accessible via the Kew Tree of Life Explorer and will be updated as further data become available. This major milestone toward a complete tree of life for all flowering plant species opens doors to a highly integrated future for angiosperm phylogenomics through the systematic sequencing of standardized nuclear markers. Our approach has the potential to serve as a much-needed bridge between the growing movement to sequence the genomes of all life on Earth and the vast phylogenomic potential of the world’s natural history collections.

	abstract = {Species in the genus Ipomoea are often difficult to identify due to their similar morphologies and their ability to hybridize with one another. An undescribed North American Ipomoea morphotype in Ipomoea series Batatas, referred here as Ipomoea Carolina morphotype, was found to be morphologically, genetically, and reproductively isolated from other locally co-occurring Ipomoea species. A previous phylogenetic analysis that included a broader sampling of species in Ipomoea series Batatas suggested that Ipomoea Carolina morphotype may be Ipomoea grandifolia, a species described as found only in South America. To evaluate these findings, we tested intrinsic cross-compatibility between Ipomoea Carolina morphotype and I. grandifolia as well as with three other co-localizing North American Ipomoea species: Ipomoea cordatotriloba, Ipomoea lacunosa, and Ipomoea leucantha. We also examined genetic differentiation using single nucleotide polymorphisms from leaf transcriptomes from multiple individuals of all five species and several outgroup species. We find no cross-incompatibility and little genetic differentiation between Ipomoea Carolina morphotype and Ipomoea grandifolia, suggesting that Ipomoea Carolina morphotype is a representative of Ipomoea grandifolia. This finding raises additional questions about the origins of Ipomoea grandifolia in North America and how its disjunct distribution could play a role in the divergence of Ipomoea grandifolia in the future.},

In 2021, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) launched a new tool that allows the impact of conservation actions on plant species to be assessed. The Green Status of Species is a new set of metrics under the Red List of Threatened Species that assigns species to recovery categories, complementary to the classic extinction risk categories. Crucially, the Green Status of Species provides methods to evaluate the impact of past conservation, and the potential for future conservation impact, on species status and recovery in a standardized way. Considering the efforts made so far for the conservation of Mediterranean threatened plants, using the Green Status of Species would be highly useful to direct future conservation policies. We, therefore, encourage botanists and practitioners working on threatened plants in the Mediterranean area to use this new assessment tool to inform conservation and recovery programs.},

            Gymnosperms represent an ancient lineage that diverged from early spermatophytes during the Devonian. The long fossil records and low diversity in living species prove their complex evolutionary history, which included ancient radiations and massive extinctions. Due to their ultra-large genome size, the whole-genome assembly of gymnosperms has only generated in the past 10 years and is now being further expanded into more taxonomic representations. Here, we provide an overview of the publicly available gymnosperm genome resources and discuss their assembly quality and recent findings in large genome architectures. In particular, we describe the genomic features most related to changes affecting the whole genome. We also highlight new realizations relative to repetitive sequence dynamics, paleopolyploidy, and long introns. Based on the results of relevant genomic studies of gymnosperms, we suggest additional efforts should be made toward exploring the genomes of medium-sized (5–15 gigabases) species. Lastly, more comparative analyses among high-quality assemblies are needed to understand the genomic shifts and the early species diversification of seed plants.},

	abstract = {Tropical deforestation continues at alarming rates with profound impacts on ecosystems, climate, and livelihoods, prompting renewed commitments to halt its continuation. Although it is well established that agriculture is a dominant driver of deforestation, rates and mechanisms remain disputed and often lack a clear evidence base. We synthesize the best available pantropical evidence to provide clarity on how agriculture drives deforestation. Although most (90 to 99\%) deforestation across the tropics 2011 to 2015 was driven by agriculture, only 45 to 65\% of deforested land became productive agriculture within a few years. Therefore, ending deforestation likely requires combining measures to create deforestation-free supply chains with landscape governance interventions. We highlight key remaining evidence gaps including deforestation trends, commodity-specific land-use dynamics, and data from tropical dry forests and forests across Africa.

            Forest loss for food
            
              Agricultural expansion is recognized as a major driver of forest loss in the tropics. However, accurate data on the links between agriculture and tropical deforestation are lacking. Pendrill
              et al
              . synthesized existing research and datasets to quantify the extent to which tropical deforestation from 2011 to 2015 was associated with agriculture. They estimated that at least 90\% of deforested land occurred in landscapes where agriculture drove forest loss, but only about half was converted into productive agricultural land. Data availability and trends vary across regions, suggesting complex links between agriculture and forest loss. —BEL

            A review shows that most tropical deforestation is associated, directly or indirectly, with agriculture.
          , 
            
              BACKGROUND
              Agricultural expansion is a primary cause of tropical deforestation and therefore a key driver of greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, and the degradation of ecosystem services vital to the livelihoods of forest-dependent and rural people. However, agriculture-driven deforestation can take many forms, from the direct expansion of pastures and cropland into forests to more complex or indirect pathways. A clear understanding of the different ways in which agriculture drives deforestation is essential for designing effective policy responses. To address this need we provide a review of the literature on pantropical agriculture-driven deforestation and synthesize the best available evidence to quantify dominant agricultural land-use changes relating to deforestation. We consider the policy implications of this assessment, especially for burgeoning demand-side and supply-chain interventions seeking to address deforestation.
            
            
              ADVANCES
              New methods and data have advanced our understanding of deforestation and subsequent land uses. However, only a handful of studies estimate agriculture-driven deforestation across the entirety of the tropics. Although these studies agree that agriculture is the dominant land use following forest clearing, their estimates of pantropical rates of agriculture-driven deforestation during the period 2011 to 2015 vary greatly—between 4.3 and 9.6 million hectares (Mha) per year—with our synthesized estimate being 6.4 to 8.8 Mha per year. This apparent uncertainty in the amount of agriculture-driven deforestation can be disentangled by distinguishing between the different ways in which agriculture contributes to deforestation; we find that while the overwhelming majority (90 to 99\%) of tropical deforestation occurs in landscapes where agriculture is the dominant driver of tree cover loss, a smaller share (45 to 65\%) of deforestation is due to the expansion of active agricultural production into forests. Multiple lines of evidence show that the remainder of agriculture-driven deforestation does not result in the expansion of productive agricultural land but instead is a result of activities such as speculative clearing, land tenure issues, short-lived and abandoned agriculture, and agriculture-related fires spreading to adjacent forests.
              Different land uses and commodities often interact to drive deforestation. However, pasture expansion is the most important driver by far, accounting for around half of the deforestation resulting in agricultural production across the tropics. Oil palm and soy cultivation together account for at least a fifth, and six other crops—rubber, cocoa, coffee, rice, maize, and cassava—likely account for most of the remainder, with large regional variations and higher levels of uncertainty.
            
            
              OUTLOOK
              This Review points to three key areas where a stronger evidence base would advance global efforts to curb agriculture-driven deforestation: First, consistent pantropical data on deforestation trends are lacking. This limits our ability to assess overall progress on reducing deforestation and account for leakage across regions. Second, with the exception of soy and oil palm the attribution of deforestation to forest risk commodities is often based on coarse-grained agricultural statistics, outdated or modeled maps, or local case studies. Third, uncertainties are greatest in dry and seasonal tropics and across the African continent in particular.
              This assessment highlights that although public and private policies promoting deforestation-free international supply chains have a critical role to play, their ability to reduce deforestation on the ground is fundamentally limited. One-third to one-half of agriculture-driven deforestation does not result in actively managed agricultural land. Moreover, the majority—approximately three-quarters—of the expansion of agriculture into forests is driven by domestic demand in producer countries, especially for beef and cereals, including much of the deforestation across the African continent. These data suggest that the potential for international supply chain measures to help reduce tropical deforestation is more likely to be achieved through interventions in deforestation risk areas that focus on strengthening sustainable rural development and territorial governance.
              
                
                  Agriculture contributes to deforestation in many ways which often interact.
                  Most tropical deforestation occurs in landscapes where agriculture is the dominant driver of forest loss. Part of this agriculture-driven deforestation results in agricultural production (left) meeting domestic and export demand for various agricultural commodities. However, agriculture-driven deforestation also occurs without expansion of managed agricultural land through several mechanisms (right), which may lead to the deforested area being abandoned or semi-abandoned. Incomplete agricultural records also explain a share of such deforestation.},

              Background
              Tuberous root formation and development is a complex process in sweet potato, which is regulated by multiple genes and environmental factors. However, the regulatory mechanism of tuberous root development is unclear.
            
            
              Results
              In this study, the transcriptome of fibrous roots (R0) and tuberous roots in three developmental stages (Rl, R2, R3) were analyzed in two sweet potato varieties, GJS-8 and XGH. A total of 22,914 and 24,446 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in GJS-8 and XGH respectively, 15,920 differential genes were shared by GJS-8 and XGH. KEGG pathway enrichment analysis showed that the DEGs shared by GJS-8 and XGH were mainly involved in “plant hormone signal transduction” “starch and sucrose metabolism” and “MAPK signal transduction”. Trihelix transcription factor (Tai6.25300) was found to be closely related to tuberous root enlargement by the comprehensive analysis of these DEGs and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
            
            
              Conclusion
              
                A hypothetical model of genetic regulatory network for tuberous root development of sweet potato is proposed, which emphasizes that some specific signal transduction pathways like “plant hormone signal transduction” “Ca
                2+
                signal” “MAPK signal transduction” and metabolic processes including “starch and sucrose metabolism” and “cell cycle and cell wall metabolism” are related to tuberous root development in sweet potato. These results provide new insights into the molecular mechanism of tuberous root development in sweet potato.},

They produce medicinally important constituents called ergot alkaloids, which are stored in their host plants. Previously, the fungi were reported to mainly interact with young leaves and seeds of Convolvulaceae species. However, knowledge about how ergot alkaloid-producing fungi interact with their host plants is still lacking. Therefore, we investigated the interaction of Periglandula fungus with different plant parts of Ipomoea asarifolia, using molecular, histochemical, anatomical and micromorphological techniques. Our findings confirm the presence of Periglandula ipomoeae on six out of the eight plant parts examined (young folded leaves, mature leaves, flower buds, mature flowers, young seeds and mature seeds). The fungus was mostly distributed along external plant surfaces, and particularly on areas that were relatively unexposed. Our results suggest that the density of fungal mycelium varies depending on glandular trichome density and the growth stage of the host plant. Detection of the fungus in the flowers of its host plant, for the first time, fills a missing link in understanding how vertical transmission of Periglandula species occurs.},

Choisy (Convolvulaceae) is one species that possesses various external secretory organs hypothesized to be ecologically important. This study, therefore, aimed to investigate five secretory structures (nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, staminal hairs, and foliar glands) using micromorphology, anatomy, histochemistry, and field observations of plant–animal interactions in order to assess the functional contributions of these structures. Results show that the nectary disc and petiolar nectaries are complex working units consisting of at least epidermis and ground tissue, while the other structures are glandular trichomes. Various groups of metabolites (lipids, phenolic compounds, polysaccharides, terpenoids, flavonoids, and alkaloids) were detected in all structures, while starch grains were only found in the nectary disc, petiolar nectaries, and their adjacent tissues. Integrating preliminary observation of animal visitors with micromorphological, anatomical, and histochemical results, two hypotheses are proposed: (I) nectary disc and staminal hairs are important for pollination as they potentially attract and reward floral visitors, and (II) petiolar nectaries, calycinal glands, and foliar glands contribute to plant defense. Specifically, petiolar nectaries and calycinal glands provide protection from herbivores via guard ants, while calycinal and foliar glands may use plant metabolites to help prevent tissue damage from dehydration and insolation.},

            The hexaploid sweetpotato is one of the most important root crops worldwide. However, its genetic origins are controversial. In this study, we identified two progenitors of sweetpotato by horizontal gene transferred
            Ib
            T-DNA and haplotype-based phylogenetic analysis. The diploid progenitor is the diploid form of

This study assessed disease susceptibility of the storage root surface, storage root cambium, and slips (vine cuttings) of 48 sweetpotato cultivars, advanced breeding lines, and wild relative accessions. We also characterized the effect of storage root development on susceptibility to C. fimbriata. None of the cultivars examined at the storage root level were resistant, with most cultivars exhibiting similar levels of susceptibility. In storage roots, Jewel and Covington were the least susceptible and significantly different from White Bonita, the most susceptible cultivar. In the slip, significant differences in disease incidence were observed for above- and below-ground plant structures among cultivars, advanced breeding lines, and wild relative accessions. Burgundy and Ipomoea littoralis displayed less below-ground disease incidence compared with NASPOT 8, Sunnyside, and LSU-417, the most susceptible cultivars. Correlation of black rot susceptibility between storage roots and slips was not significant, suggesting that slip assays are not useful to predict resistance in storage roots. Immature, early-developing storage roots were comparatively more susceptible than older, fully developed storage roots. The high significant correlation between the storage root cross-section area and the cross-sectional lesion ratio suggests the presence of an unfavorable environment for C. fimbriata as the storage root develops. Incorporating applications of effective fungicides at transplanting and during early-storage root development when sweetpotato tissues are most susceptible to black rot infection may improve disease management efforts.},

	abstract = {Sweet potato dispersal from Americas to French Polynesia predates known human colonization periods, therefore being a long-standing dilemma. According to recent phylogenetic studies, the most likely hypothesis to explain this migration is the sea-drift long-distance dispersal, but no research indicating the response of I. batatasseeds to seawater conditions have been performed so far. The aim of this study was to understand seawater resistance in I. batatas, an essential feature for the sea-drift natural dispersal hypothesis, thus shedding light on the historical biogeography of this species, which also has implications on human civilization history, as the archaeological presence of sweet potato in both continents has been used as an evidence of pre-Columbian contacts between ancient civilizations. The experiment consisted of submitting sweet potato seeds to seawater treatments and observing the respective germination rates after different periods of immersion. Subsequently, one-way ANOVAs were conducted to test for significant differences between groups. All seeds from the seawater immersion treatments germinated, which confirms that I. batatas seeds are resistant to seawater salinity for a period of 120 days. Our results support the sea-drift natural dispersal hypothesis, thus shedding light on part of the logical conditions for one of the major hypotheses on the historical biogeography of this species, which also plays an important role in the discussions related to prehistorical human mobility in Polynesian islands.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            
              Background
              The identification of tropical African wood species based on microscopic imagery is a challenging problem due to the heterogeneous nature of the composition of wood combined with the vast number of candidate species. Image classification methods that rely on machine learning can facilitate this identification, provided that sufficient training material is available. Despite the fact that the three main anatomical sections contain information that is relevant for species identification, current methods only rely on transverse sections. Additionally, commonly used procedures for evaluating the performance of these methods neglect the fact that multiple images often originate from the same tree, leading to an overly optimistic estimate of the performance.
            
            
              Results
              We introduce a new image dataset containing microscopic images of the three main anatomical sections of 77 Congolese wood species. A dedicated multi-view image classification method is developed and obtains an accuracy (computed using the naive but common approach) of 95\%, outperforming the single-view methods by a large margin. An in-depth analysis shows that naive accuracy estimates can lead to a dramatic over-prediction, of up to 60\%, of the accuracy.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Additional images from non-transverse sections can boost the performance of machine-learning-based wood species identification methods. Additionally, care should be taken when evaluating the performance of machine-learning-based wood species identification methods to avoid an overestimation of the performance.},

	abstract = {The aim of the present study was to find new low molecular natural compounds in members of the Convolvulaceae family. The research concentrated on alkaloids which are of particular interest from a pharmacological point of view. The GC-MS analysis was the most important tool in examining the alkaline extracts of the samples taken from almost 50 species of the Convolvulaceae. The results of the GC-MS screening confirmed the extraordinary variety of alkaloid groups in Convolvulaceae: Together with its closely related sister family Solanaceae, the Convolvulaceae are among the richest sources of tropane alkaloids in higher plants. Regarding the pyrrolidine alkaloids, an almost ubiquitous presence was proved in Convolvulaceae. Because of their exclusive presence in Convolvulaceae as the only family of higher plants ergolines can be considered as a family characteristic; however, their distribution is erratic. Pyrrolizidines such as minalobines and ipangulines were confirmed as a common phytochemical feature of the Ipomoea species of the Subgenus Quamoclit Sectio Mina. From Ipomoea cristulata Hallier f. minalobine O was isolated as a new natural compound. The GC-MS analysis of the African species Falkia repens L. f. revealed a plethora of aliphatic and aromatic esters of both epimers of 3-tropanol. For the first time aliphatic tropanol esters were isolated from Convolvulaceae, in particular 3α-acetoxytropane and its N-oxide, 3β-acetoxytropane-N-oxide, 3α-(2’-methylbutyryloxy)tropane, 3β-(2’-methylbutyryloxy)tropane and its N-oxide as well as 3β- tigloyloxytropane-N-oxide, and, in addition, 3β-trans-isoferuloyloxytropane. The new natural compound astrimalvine A-N-oxide and astrimalvine B were isolated from the African Astripomoea malvacea (Klotzsch) Meeuse, the latter substance in its genuine form probably existing as a N-oxide as well. With the isolation of five tropane-N-oxides from Falkia repens and Astripomoea malvacea, the present study provided evidence that tropane alkaloids in Convolvulaceae are accumulated in the form of their N-oxides much more frequently than had been assumed so far. By synthezising so-called Mosher esters, a 1’R-configuration was attributed to consabatine isolated from the Mediterranean Convolvulus sabatius Viv.. The bonabilines from the Madagascan Bonamia spectabilis (Choisy) Hallier f. turned out to be uniquely novel natural compounds due to their acylic moieties which are monoterpenoic acids of the Pinane type. Because of the analogy between the hydroxylation in position 3’ of bonabiline A and the primary hydroxyl moiety of the tropic acid of atropine/hyoscyamine, the antagonistic activity of bonabiline A and its 2’,3’-anhydro derivate bonabiline B was tested on muscarinic M3-receptors. Ipvelutine isolated from the Australian Ipomoea velutina R. Br. was identified as 7β-acetoxy-2α-tigloyloxytropane. Because of its substitution pattern it can be assigned to a group of tropane alkaloids solely detected in Convolvulaceae so far.},

The program comprises two complementary elements—mapping of fire histories based upon interpretation of satellite imagery, and assessment of vegetation at a large series of permanent monitoring plots. The program commenced formally in 1995, at which time establishment and baseline sampling of vegetation in 134 plots was conducted, with re-sampling proposed at 5-year intervals up to 2010. The monitoring program has an estimated annual cost of about \$A140�000 (around 1\% of the total annual budget of the Park).
Over the period 1995–2000, the mean annual extent of burning was 40.3\%, a marginal reduction in extent from the previous 15 years, particularly for late dry season fires in lowland habitats. From the baseline (1995) and subsequent re-sampling (2000) of the vegetation plots, 963 plant taxa have been recorded. The power of the program to detect change in the frequency or abundance of individual species was poor, especially for ground-layer species, largely because of typically substantial variability in abundance across plots and sampling events, and because of the high proportion of species recorded from few samples. Notwithstanding this constraint, five tree species (of 47 recorded from sufficient samples to test), nine shrub species (from 121) and 27 ground-layer species (from 111) showed significant change in abundance between the baseline and subsequent sampling. However when species were grouped into strata and life-form categories, major changes were evident over this 5�year period, particularly with increases in cover of trees and shrubs. Such changes were related to a range of environmental and fire regime parameters of the plots, with increase in woody cover but reduction in cover and species richness of herbs in those plots experiencing lower frequency of fires.},

	abstract = {Convolvulaceae is a family of c. 2,000 species, distributed across 60 currently recognized genera. It includes species of high economic importance, such as the crop sweet potato (
              Ipomoea batatas
              L.), the ornamental morning glories (
              Ipomoea
              L.), bindweeds (
              Convolvulus
              L.), and dodders, the parasitic vines (
              Cuscuta
              L.). Earlier phylogenetic studies, based predominantly on chloroplast markers or a single nuclear region, have provided a framework for systematic studies of the family, but uncertainty remains at the level of the relationships among subfamilies, tribes, and genera, hindering evolutionary inferences and taxonomic advances. One of the enduring enigmas has been the relationship of
              Cuscuta
              to the rest of Convolvulaceae. Other examples of unresolved issues include the monophyly and relationships within Merremieae, the “bifid-style” clade (Dicranostyloideae), as well as the relative positions of
              Erycibe
              Roxb. and Cardiochlamyeae. In this study, we explore a large dataset of nuclear genes generated using Angiosperms353 kit, as a contribution to resolving some of these remaining phylogenetic uncertainties within Convolvulaceae. For the first time, a strongly supported backbone of the family is provided.
              Cuscuta
              is confirmed to belong within family Convolvulaceae. “Merremieae,” in their former tribal circumscription, are recovered as non-monophyletic, with the unexpected placement of
              Distimake
              Raf. as sister to the clade that contains Ipomoeeae and
              Decalobanthus
              Ooststr., and Convolvuleae nested within the remaining “Merremieae.” The monophyly of Dicranostyloideae, including
              Jacquemontia
              Choisy, is strongly supported, albeit novel relationships between genera are hypothesized, challenging the current tribal delimitation. The exact placements of
              Erycibe
              and
              Cuscuta
              remain uncertain, requiring further investigation. Our study explores the benefits and limitations of increasing sequence data in resolving higher-level relationships within Convolvulaceae, and highlights the need for expanded taxonomic sampling, to facilitate a much-needed revised classification of the family.},

Lam.) from the family Convolvulaceae is a hexaploid species with 2n = 6x = 90, and has been controversial regarding its nature as an autopolyploid arising within a species or allopolyploid forming between species. Here, we developed oligonucleotide-based painting probes for two chromosomes of I.nil, a model diploid Ipomoea species. Using these probes, we revealed pairing behavior of homoeologous chromosomes in I. batatas and its two possible polyploid ancestral species, tetraploid I. tabascana (2n = 4x = 60) and hexaploid I. trifida (2n = 6x = 90). Chromosome painting analysis revealed a high percentage of quadrivalent formation in zygotene-pachytene cells of I. tabascana, which supported that I. tabascana was an autotetraploid likely derived by doubling of structurally similar and homologous genomes rather than a hybrid between I. batatas and I. trifida (2x). The high frequency of hexavalent/bivalent and tetravalent pairing was observed in I. trifida (6x) and I. batatas. However, the percentage of hexavalent pairing in I. trifida (6x) was far higher than that in I. batatas. Thus, present results tended to support that I. trifida (6x) was an autohexaploid, while I. batatas was more likely to be a segmental allohexaploid.},

El objetivo principal del trabajo es reconstruir las estrategias de explotación de este tipo de biomas considerados marginales para la ocupación humana. De este modo se pudo demostrar que los cazadores-recolectores perturbaron el bosque desde su ocupación con el fin de incrementar la capacidad de carga del medio, lo que con el tiempo desemboca en la producción artificial de alimentos a través de la dispersión intencional de taxas vegetales autóctonas.

No obstante, este cambio no hay que verlo como una ruptura en las formas de vida, sino más bien como una estrategia que forma parte de un continuum con la recolección y con la caza; es decir, aquellos cazadores-recolectores continuaron con su modelo de ocupación del territorio basado principalmente en mantener la movilidad como una estrategia eficaz de acceso a los recursos, así como a la interacción con otras bandas de territorios compartidos.

Tales inferencias fueron posibles a través de la aplicación de varias metodologías de análisis de registro arqueológico tales como la paleobotánica, la arqueozoología, el estudio de la industria lítica, procesos de formación de sitio, dataciones radiométricas, análisis espacial y algoritmos estadísticos.},

            The origin of plants and their colonization of land fundamentally transformed the terrestrial environment. Here we elucidate the basis of this formative episode in Earth history through patterns of lineage, gene and genome evolution. We use new fossil calibrations, a relative clade age calibration (informed by horizontal gene transfer) and new phylogenomic methods for mapping gene family origins. Distinct rooting strategies resolve tracheophytes (vascular plants) and bryophytes (non-vascular plants) as monophyletic sister groups that diverged during the Cambrian, 515–494 million years ago. The embryophyte stem is characterized by a burst of gene innovation, while bryophytes subsequently experienced an equally dramatic episode of reductive genome evolution in which they lost genes associated with the elaboration of vasculature and the stomatal complex. Overall, our analyses reveal that extant tracheophytes and bryophytes are both highly derived from a more complex ancestral land plant. Understanding the origin of land plants requires tracing character evolution across a diversity of modern lineages.},

Today, significant field crops include sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), manioc (Manihot esculenta), bananas and plantains (Musa cvs.), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), yams (Dioscorea spp.) and taro (Colocasia esculenta). In comparison to sexually-reproduced crops, especially cereals and legumes, the domestication syndrome in vegetatively-propagated field crops is poorly defined.
            
            
              Aims and scope
              Here, a range of phenotypic traits potentially comprising a syndrome associated with early domestication of vegetatively-propagated field crops is proposed, including: mode of reproduction, yield of edible portion, ease of harvesting, defensive adaptations, timing of production and plant architecture. The archaeobotanical visibility of these syndrome traits is considered with a view to the reconstruction of the geographical and historical pathways of domestication for vegetatively-propagated field crops in the past.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although convergent phenotypic traits are identified, none are ubiquitous and some are divergent. In contrast to cereals and legumes, several traits seem to represent varying degrees of plastic response to growth environment and practices of cultivation, as opposed to solely morphogenetic ‘fixation’.},

	abstract = {It has long been believed that climate shifts during the last 2 million years had a pivotal role in the evolution of our genus Homo. However, given the limited number of representative palaeo-climate datasets from regions of anthropological interest, it has remained challenging to quantify this linkage. Here, we use an unprecedented transient Pleistocene coupled general circulation model simulation in combination with an extensive compilation of fossil and archaeological records to study the spatiotemporal habitat suitability for five hominin species over the past 2 million years. We show that astronomically forced changes in temperature, rainfall and terrestrial net primary production had a major impact on the observed distributions of these species. During the Early Pleistocene, hominins settled primarily in environments with weak orbital-scale climate variability. This behaviour changed substantially after the mid-Pleistocene transition, when archaic humans became global wanderers who adapted to a wide range of spatial climatic gradients. Analysis of the simulated hominin habitat overlap from approximately 300–400 thousand years ago further suggests that antiphased climate disruptions in southern Africa and Eurasia contributed to the evolutionary transformation of Homo heidelbergensis populations into Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, respectively. Our robust numerical simulations of climate-induced habitat changes provide a framework to test hypotheses on our human origin.},

Cluster analysis using Jacquard similarity index indicated a greater similarity among different plant species in the same locality than among the populations at different places, in relation to floral visitor sets.

Species find themselves in novel environments, within communities assembled from never before encountered mixtures of invasives and natives. The speed with which the biotic and abiotic environment of species has changed has already altered the evolutionary trajectory of species, a trend that promises to escalate. In this article, I reflect upon this altered course of evolution. Human activities have reshaped selection pressures, favouring individuals that better survive in our built landscapes, that avoid our hunting and fishing, and that best tolerate the species that we have introduced. Human-altered selection pressures have also modified how organisms live and move through the landscape, and even the nature of reproduction and genome structure. Humans are also shaping selection pressures at the species level, and I discuss how species traits are affecting both extinction and speciation rates in the Anthropocene.},

Modern plant genomes harbor evidence of multiple rounds of past polyploidization events, often followed by massive silencing and elimination of duplicated genes. Recent studies have refined our inferences of the number and timing of polyploidy events and the impact of these events on genome structure. Many polyploids experience extensive and rapid genomic alterations, some arising with the onset of polyploidy. Survivorship of duplicated genes are differential across gene classes, with some duplicate genes more prone to retention than others. Recent theory is now supported by evidence showing that genes that are retained in duplicate typically diversify in function or undergo subfunctionalization. Polyploidy has extensive effects on gene expression, with gene silencing accompanying polyploid formation and continuing over evolutionary time.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Rate variation adds considerable complexity to divergence time estimation in molecular phylogenies. Here, we evaluate the impact of lineage-specific rates—which we define as among-branch-rate-variation that acts consistently across the entire genome. We compare its impact to residual rates—defined as among-branch-rate-variation that shows a different pattern of rate variation at each sampled locus, and gene-specific rates—defined as variation in the average rate across all branches at each sampled locus. We show that lineage-specific rates lead to erroneous divergence time estimates, regardless of how many loci are sampled. Further, we show that stronger lineage-specific rates lead to increasing error. This contrasts to residual rates and gene-specific rates, where sampling more loci significantly reduces error. If divergence times are inferred in a Bayesian framework, we highlight that error caused by lineage-specific rates significantly reduces the probability that the 95\% highest posterior density includes the correct value, and leads to sensitivity to the prior. Use of a more complex rate prior—which has recently been proposed to model rate variation more accurately—does not affect these conclusions. Finally, we show that the scale of lineage-specific rates used in our simulation experiments is comparable to that of an empirical data set for the angiosperm genus Ipomoea. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that lineage-specific rates cause error in divergence time estimates, and that this error is not overcome by analyzing genomic scale multilocus data sets.

	abstract = {Background: Natural plant toxins can cause food poisoning upon intentional or unintentional consumption of wild plants. Some toxic wild plants can be mistaken for edible species because of their morphological resemblance. This study examined a poisoning case report of schoolchildren who consumed a steamed tuberous root of wild Ipomoea, misidentified as I. mauritiana, and experienced gastrointestinal toxicity.   Objectives: This study aimed to identify the tuberous root of wild Ipomoea using the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region as a DNA barcode and characterize compounds obtained using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).   Materials and methods: DNA was extracted from fresh and cooked samples of the storage root. PCR amplification and DNA sequencing of the entire ITS region were performed. FastTree and maximum likelihood analyses were used to obtain phylogenetic trees of the Ipomoea species. Root extracts were prepared for GC-MS analysis, and potentially harmful phytochemicals responsible for poisonous plant exposure were predicted based on a well-established plant toxin database.   Results: ITS phylogeny showed a close relationship between wild toxic Ipomoea and edible I. mauritiana. The chemometric profile obtained from GC-MS analysis of the root extracts revealed the presence of 31 phytochemicals. Among them, two putatively toxic compounds identified were β-amyrin and coumarin.   Conclusion: Misidentification of the wild poisonous plant reported herein resulted in toxic plant ingestion. Although most poisonous plant exposures are not life threatening, measures should be taken to ensure the safety of the general public.},

This hampers progress on developing conservation targets and sustainability goals. Here we present the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Global Ecosystem Typology, a conceptually robust, scalable, spatially explicit approach for generalizations and predictions about functions, biota, risks and management remedies across the entire biosphere. The outcome of a major cross-disciplinary collaboration, this novel framework places all of Earth’s ecosystems into a unifying theoretical context to guide the transformation of ecosystem policy and management from global to local scales. This new information infrastructure will support knowledge transfer for ecosystem-specific management and restoration, globally standardized ecosystem risk assessments, natural capital accounting and progress on the post-2020 global biodiversity framework.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            The consequences of the Cretaceous–Paleogene (K–Pg) boundary (KPB) mass extinction for the evolution of plant diversity remain poorly understood, even though evolutionary turnover of plant lineages at the KPB is central to understanding assembly of the Cenozoic biota. The apparent concentration of whole genome duplication (WGD) events around the KPB may have played a role in survival and subsequent diversification of plant lineages. To gain new insights into the origins of Cenozoic biodiversity, we examine the origin and early evolution of the globally diverse legume family (Leguminosae or Fabaceae). Legumes are ecologically (co-)dominant across many vegetation types, and the fossil record suggests that they rose to such prominence after the KPB in parallel with several well-studied animal clades including Placentalia and Neoaves. Furthermore, multiple WGD events are hypothesized to have occurred early in legume evolution. Using a recently inferred phylogenomic framework, we investigate the placement of WGDs during early legume evolution using gene tree reconciliation methods, gene count data and phylogenetic supernetwork reconstruction. Using 20 fossil calibrations we estimate a revised timeline of legume evolution based on 36 nuclear genes selected as informative and evolving in an approximately clock-like fashion. To establish the timing of WGDs we also date duplication nodes in gene trees. Results suggest either a pan-legume WGD event on the stem lineage of the family, or an allopolyploid event involving (some of) the earliest lineages within the crown group, with additional nested WGDs subtending subfamilies Papilionoideae and Detarioideae. Gene tree reconciliation methods that do not account for allopolyploidy may be misleading in inferring an earlier WGD event at the time of divergence of the two parental lineages of the polyploid, suggesting that the allopolyploid scenario is more likely. We show that the crown age of the legumes dates to the Maastrichtian or early Paleocene and that, apart from the Detarioideae WGD, paleopolyploidy occurred close to the KPB. We conclude that the early evolution of the legumes followed a complex history, in which multiple auto- and/or allopolyploidy events coincided with rapid diversification and in association with the mass extinction event at the KPB, ultimately underpinning the evolutionary success of the Leguminosae in the Cenozoic.

These cultivars were found to contain several carotenoids unique to sweetpotato tubers such as β-carotene-5,6,5′,8′-diepoxide and β-carotene-5,8-epoxide. Next, we isolated two kinds of carotene cyclase genes that encode lycopene β- and ε-cyclases from the WS and W71 leaves, by RT-PCR and subsequent RACE. Two and three lycopene β-cyclase gene sequences were, respectively, isolated from WS, named
              IbLCYb1
              ,
              2
              , and from W71,
              IbLCYb3
              ,
              4
              ,
              5
              . Meanwhile, only a single lycopene ε-cyclase gene sequence, designated
              IbLCYe
              , was isolated from both WS and W71. These genes were separately introduced into a lycopene-synthesizing
              Escherichia coli
              transformed with the
              Pantoea ananatis crtE
              ,
              crtB
              and
              crtI
              genes, followed by HPLC analysis. β-Carotene was detected in
              E. coli
              cells that carried
              IbLCYb1
              -
              4
              , indicating that the
              IbLCYb1
              -
              4
              genes encode lycopene β-cyclase. Meanwhile, the introduction of
              IbLCYe
              into the lycopene-synthesizing
              E. coli
              led to efficient production of δ-carotene with a monocyclic ε-ring, providing evidence that the
              IbLCYe
              gene codes for lycopene ε-(mono)cyclase. Expression of the β- and ε-cyclase genes was analyzed as well.},

	abstract = {Background and Aims Convolvulaceae is the most advanced plant family (asterid clade) that produces seeds with physical dormancy (water-impermeable seed coat). There are several different opinions about the nature of the specialized structure (‘water gap’) in the seed coat through which water initially enters seeds of Convolvulaceae, but none of them has been documented clearly. The primary aim of the study was to identify the water gap in seeds of Ipomoea lacunosa (Convolvulaceae) and to describe its morphology, anatomy and function. Methods Light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, tissue-sectioning, dye-tracking and blocking experiments were used to describe the morphology, anatomy and function of the water gap in seeds of I. lacunosa. Key Results Dormancy-breaking treatments caused slits to form around the two bulges on the seed coat adjacent to the hilum, and dye entered the seed only via the disrupted bulges. Bulge anatomy differs from that of the rest of the seed coat. Sclereid cells of the bulges are more compacted and elongated than those in the hilum pad and in the rest of the seed coat away from the bulges. Conclusions The transition area between elongated and square-shaped sclereid cells is the place where the water gap opens. Morphology/anatomy of the water gap in Convolvulaceae differs from that of taxa in the other 11 angiosperm plant families that produce seeds with physical dormancy for which it has been described.},

These cultivars consisted of Chinese and Japanese materials, landraces as well as cultivars derived either from hybrid or polycross breeding in Taiwan. SSR analysis from eight primer pairs revealed a total of 20 alleles of which 17 were polymorphic (85.0\% polymorphism). An average of 2.5 alleles were obtained per SSR primer pair. On average 2.1 alleles per polymorphic SSR locus were amplified. The construction of genetic relationships using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) and principal coordinate analysis (PCA) demonstrated the capability of simple sequence repeats in sweet potato genotype identification and classification of genetic relationships. The UPGMA clustering and PCA revealed that polycross-derived cultivars possessed high levels of genetic diversity and originated from various genetic resources, and suggested the usefulness of polycross breeding strategy in spite of frequent cross-incompatibility. Moreover, high level of genetic variation in polycross breeding lines would assist in obtaining elite sweet potato materials in the future. In addition, most landraces were distantly related to the Chinese and Japanese materials and probably originated from Java and Brahman.},

We find early domestication selection patterns supporting the neural crest hypothesis, which provides a unified developmental origin for common domestic traits. Within the past 2.3 thousand years, horses lost genetic diversity and archaic DNA tracts introgressed from a now-extinct lineage. They accumulated deleterious mutations later than expected under the cost-of-domestication hypothesis, probably because of breeding from limited numbers of stallions. We also reveal that Iron Age Scythian steppe nomads implemented breeding strategies involving no detectable inbreeding and selection for coat-color variation and robust forelimbs.},

Competition for essential resources may lead to divergence in heritable traits that reduces interspecific competition leading to increased rate of genetic divergence. Conversely, hybridization and backcrossing can lead to genetic convergence. Here, we study a population of a hybrid species, the Italian sparrow (Passer italiae), before and after it came into secondary contact with one of its parent species, the Spanish sparrow (P. hispaniolensis), in 2013. We demonstrate strong consequences of interspecific competition: Italian sparrows were kept away from a popular feeding site by its parent species, resulting in poorer body condition and a significant drop in population size. Although no significant morphological change could be detected, after only 3 years of sympatry, the Italian sparrows had diverged significantly from the Spanish sparrows across a set of 81 protein-coding genes. These temporal genetic changes are mirrored by genetic divergence observed in older sympatric Italian sparrow populations within the same area of contact. Compared with microallopatric birds, sympatric ones are genetically more diverged from Spanish sparrows. Six significant outlier genes in the temporal and spatial comparison (i.e. showing the greatest displacement) have all been found to be associated with learning and neural development in other bird species.},

	abstract = {The importance of hybridization in plant speciation and evolution has been debated for decades, with opposing views of hybridization as either a creative evolutionary force or evolutionary noise. Hybrid speciation may occur at either the homoploid (i.e., between two species of the same ploidy) or the polyploid level, each with its attendant genetic and evolutionary consequences. Whereas allopolyploidy (i.e., resulting from hybridization and genome doubling) has long been recognized as an important mode of plant speciation, the implications of genome duplication have typically not been taken into account in most fields of plant biology. Recent developments in genomics are revolutionizing our views of angiosperm genomes, demonstrating that perhaps all angiosperms have likely undergone at least one round of polyploidization and that hybridization has been an important force in generating angiosperm species diversity. Hybridization and polyploid formation continue to generate species diversity, with several new allopolyploids having originated just within the past century or so. The origins of polyploid species—whether via hybridization between species or between genetically differentiated populations of a single species—and the immediate genetic consequences of polyploid formation are therefore receiving enthusiastic attention. The time is therefore right for a review of the role of hybridization in plant speciation.},

What information animals have evolved to extract from a starry sky and how they do so, is a topic of study that combines the practical and theoretical challenges faced by both astronomers and field biologists. While a number of animal species have been demonstrated to use the stars as a source of directional information, the strategies that these animals use to convert this complex and variable pattern of dim-light points into a reliable ‘stellar orientation’ cue have been more difficult to ascertain. In this review, we assess the stars as a visual stimulus that conveys directional information, and compare the bodies of evidence available for the different stellar orientation strategies proposed to date. In this context, we also introduce new technologies that may aid in the study of stellar orientation, and suggest how field experiments may be used to characterize the mechanisms underlying stellar orientation.},

We reconstructed the past isotopic composition (δ 18O, δD,17 O-excess, and d-excess) of water in Lake Chichancanab, Mexico, using a technique that involves isotopic analysis of the structurally bound water in sedimentary gypsum, which was deposited under drought conditions. The triple oxygen and hydrogen isotope data provide a direct measure of past changes in lake hydrology. We modeled the data and conclude that annual precipitation decreased between 41 and 54\% (with intervals of up to 70\% rainfall reduction during peak drought conditions) and that relative humidity declined by 2 to 7\% compared to present-day conditions.},

	abstract = {Given the proliferation of species concepts in recent years, it might seem that the species problem-the difficulty of reaching agreement about the definition of the species category-is as far from being solved as it has ever been. On the contrary, the species problem has, for the most part, already been solved. Despite the considerable diversity among contemporary views on species, all are encompassed by a single, general concept that equates species with segments of population-level lineages. Because this population lineage concept underlies virtually all modem ideas about species, it bears on almost every historical and philosophical question that one would care to ask about those ideas, including the major themes of this volume. In this essay, I describe the general concept of species as segments of population lineages and show how it encompasses the diversity of modem views on species. I then discuss two assumptions that, despite widespread agreement about the general nature of species, lead to incompatible species concepts. I show how eliminating one of those assumptions, which entails reconsidering the defin-ing properties of the species category, effectively solves the species problem. I then use this perspective to clarify several philosophical issues concerning species, including the role of the species concept in biology, the individuality of species, whether the species category is a relational concept, monistic versus pluralistic views of species, and species realism. Finally, I briefly de-scribe the history of the lineage concept of species.},

In all three populations, ancestry from the “minor” parental species is more common in regions of high recombination and where there is linkage to fewer putative targets of selection. The same patterns are apparent in a reanalysis of human and archaic admixture. These results support models in which ancestry from the minor parental species is more likely to persist when rapidly uncoupled from alleles that are deleterious in hybrids. Our analyses further indicate that selection on swordtail hybrids stems predominantly from deleterious combinations of epistatically interacting alleles.},

	abstract = {Recent studies have broadened our knowledge regarding the origins of agriculture in southwest Asia by highlighting the multiregional and protracted nature of plant domestication. However, there have been few archaeobotanical data to examine whether the early adoption of wild cereal cultivation and the subsequent appearance of domesticated-type cereals occurred in parallel across southwest Asia, or if chronological differences existed between regions. The evaluation of the available archaeobotanical evidence indicates that during Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) cultivation of wild cereal species was common in regions such as the southern-central Levant and the Upper Euphrates area, but the plant-based subsistence in the eastern Fertile Crescent (southeast Turkey, Iran, and Iraq) focused on the exploitation of plants such as legumes, goatgrass, fruits, and nuts. Around 10.7–10.2 ka Cal BP (early Pre-Pottery Neolithic B), the predominant exploitation of cereals continued in the southern-central Levant and is correlated with the appearance of significant proportions (30\%) of domesticated-type cereal chaff in the archaeobotanical record. In the eastern Fertile Crescent exploitation of legumes, fruits, nuts, and grasses continued, and in the Euphrates legumes predominated. In these two regions domesticated-type cereal chaff ({\textgreater}10\%) is not identified until the middle and late Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (10.2–8.3 ka Cal BP). We propose that the cultivation of wild and domesticated cereals developed at different times across southwest Asia and was conditioned by the regionally diverse plant-based subsistence strategies adopted by Pre-Pottery Neolithic groups.},

              Despite being one of the most important foodstuffs consumed in the modern world, the origins of bread are still largely unknown. Here we report the earliest empirical evidence for the preparation of bread-like products by Natufian hunter-gatherers, 4,000 years before the emergence of the Neolithic agricultural way of life. The discovery of charred food remains has allowed for the reconstruction of the
              chaîne opératoire
              for the early production of bread-like products. Our results suggest the use of the wild ancestors of domesticated cereals (e.g. wild einkorn) and club-rush tubers to produce flat bread-like products. Cereal-based meals such as bread probably become staples when Neolithic farmers started to rely on the cultivation of domesticated cereal species for their subsistence.

              The origins of bread have long been associated with the emergence of agriculture and cereal domestication during the Neolithic in southwest Asia. In this study we analyze a total of 24 charred food remains from Shubayqa 1, a Natufian hunter-gatherer site located in northeastern Jordan and dated to 14.6–11.6 ka cal BP. Our finds provide empirical data to demonstrate that the preparation and consumption of bread-like products predated the emergence of agriculture by at least 4,000 years. The interdisciplinary analyses indicate the use of some of the “founder crops” of southwest Asian agriculture (e.g.,
              Triticum boeoticum
              , wild einkorn) and root foods (e.g.,
              Bolboschoenus glaucus
              , club-rush tubers) to produce flat bread-like products. The available archaeobotanical evidence for the Natufian period indicates that cereal exploitation was not common during this time, and it is most likely that cereal-based meals like bread become staples only when agriculture was firmly established.},

We examined the effect of landscape features on gene flow in the invasive grass Brachypodium sylvaticum across an urban–rural interface at the edge of its expanding range. We used genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism surveys of individuals from 22 locations. Resistance surfaces were created for each landscape feature, using ResistanceGA to optimize resistance parameters. Our Structure analysis identified three distinct clusters, and diversity analyses support the existence of at least three local introductions. Multiple regression on distance matrices showed no evidence that development, roads, canopy cover or agriculture had a significant influence on genetic distance in B. sylvaticum. Geographical distance was a mediocre predictor of genetic distance and reflected geographical clustering. The model of rivers acting as a conduit explained a large portion of variation in genetic distance, but the lack of evidence of directional gene flow eliminated hydrochory as a dispersal mechanism. These results and observations of the distribution of populations in disturbed sites indicate that the influence of rivers on patterns of dispersal of B. sylvaticum probably reflects seed dispersal due to human recreational activity.},

Support for sweetpotato improvement research in breeding and genetics programs, and maintenance of sweetpotato germplasm collections is essential for preserving food security for future generations. Germplasm collections seek to preserve phenotypic and genotypic diversity through accession characterization. However, due to its genetic complexity, high heterogeneity, polyploid genome, phenotypic plasticity, and high flower production variability, sweetpotato genetic characterization is challenging. Here, we characterize the genetic diversity and population structure of 604 accessions from the sweetpotato germplasm collection maintained by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service (ARS), Plant Genetic Resources Conservation Unit (PGRCU) in Griffin, Georgia, United States. Using the genotyping-by-sequencing platform (GBSpoly) and bioinformatic pipelines (ngsComposer and GBSapp), a total of 102,870 polymorphic SNPs with hexaploid dosage calls were identified from the 604 accessions. Discriminant analysis of principal components (DAPC) and Bayesian clustering identified six unique genetic groupings across seven broad geographic regions. Genetic diversity analyses using the hexaploid data set revealed ample genetic diversity among the analyzed collection in concordance with previous analyses. Following population structure and diversity analyses, breeder germplasm subsets of 24, 48, 96, and 384 accessions were established using K-means clustering with manual selection to maintain phenotypic and genotypic diversity. The genetic characterization of the PGRCU sweetpotato germplasm collection and breeder germplasm subsets developed in this study provide the foundation for future association studies and serve as precursors toward phenotyping studies aimed at linking genotype with phenotype.},

Analyses indicate that Neotropical diversity has mostly expanded through time (70\% of the clades), while scenarios of saturated and declining diversity account for 21\% and 9\% of Neotropical diversity, respectively. Five biogeographic areas are identified as distinctive units of long-term Neotropical evolution, including Pan-Amazonia, the Dry Diagonal, and Bahama-Antilles. Diversification dynamics do not differ across these areas, suggesting no geographic structure in long-term Neotropical diversification. In contrast, diversification dynamics differ across taxa: plant diversity mostly expanded through time (88\%), while a substantial fraction (43\%) of tetrapod diversity accumulated at a slower pace or declined towards the present. These opposite evolutionary patterns may reflect different capacities for plants and tetrapods to cope with past climate changes.},

            Large mammal herbivores are important drivers of plant evolution and vegetation patterns, but the extent to which plant trait and ecosystem geography currently reflect the historical distribution of extinct megafauna is unknown. We address this question for South and Central America (Neotropical biogeographic realm) by compiling data on plant defence traits, climate, soil, and fire, as well as on the historical distribution of extinct megafauna and extant mammal herbivores. We show that historical mammal herbivory, especially by extinct megafauna, and soil fertility explain substantial variability in wood density, leaf size, spines and latex. We also identified three distinct regions (‘‘antiherbiomes’’), differing in plant defences, environmental conditions, and megafauna history. These patterns largely matched those observed in African ecosystems, where abundant megafauna still roams, and suggest that some ecoregions experienced savanna-to-forest shifts following megafauna extinctions. Here, we show that extinct megafauna left a significant imprint on current ecosystem biogeography.},

Although the prevalence of polyploidy in plants is well documented, the molecular and cytological consequences are understood largely from newly formed polyploids (neopolyploids) that have been grown experimentally. Classical cytological and molecular cytogenetic studies both have shown that experimental neoallopolyploids often have meiotic irregularities, producing chromosomally variable gametes and progeny; however, little is known about the extent or duration of chromosomal variation in natural neoallopolyploid populations. We report the results of a molecular cytogenetic study on natural populations of a neoallopolyploid,
              Tragopogon miscellus
              , which formed multiple times in the past 80 y. Using genomic and fluorescence in situ hybridization, we uncovered massive and repeated patterns of chromosomal variation in all populations. No population was fixed for a particular karyotype; 76\% of the individuals showed intergenomic translocations, and 69\% were aneuploid for one or more chromosomes. Importantly, 85\% of plants exhibiting aneuploidy still had the expected chromosome number, mostly through reciprocal monosomy-trisomy of homeologous chromosomes (1:3 copies) or nullisomy-tetrasomy (0:4 copies). The extensive chromosomal variation still present after

              . 40 generations in this biennial species suggests that substantial and prolonged chromosomal instability might be common in natural populations after whole genome duplication.

              The transition from unicellular to multicellular life was one of a few major events in the history of life that created new opportunities for more complex biological systems to evolve. Predation is hypothesized as one selective pressure that may have driven the evolution of multicellularity. Here we show that
              de novo
              origins of simple multicellularity can evolve in response to predation. We subjected outcrossed populations of the unicellular green alga
              Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
              to selection by the filter-feeding predator
              Paramecium tetraurelia
              . Two of five experimental populations evolved multicellular structures not observed in unselected control populations within {\textasciitilde}750 asexual generations. Considerable variation exists in the evolved multicellular life cycles, with both cell number and propagule size varying among isolates. Survival assays show that evolved multicellular traits provide effective protection against predation. These results support the hypothesis that selection imposed by predators may have played a role in some origins of multicellularity.},

            Rising temperatures can lead to the occurrence of a large-scale climatic event, such as the melting of Greenland ice sheet, weakening the AMOC and further increasing dissimilarities between current and future climate. The impacts of such an event are still poorly assessed. Here, we evaluate those impacts across megadiverse countries on 21,146 species of tetrapods and vascular plants using the pessimistic climate change scenario (RCP 8.5) and four different scenarios of Greenland’s ice sheet melting. We show that RCP 8.5 emission scenario would lead to a widespread reduction in species’ geographic ranges (28–48\%), which is projected to be magnified (58–99\%) with any added contribution from the melting of Greenland. Also, declines in the potential geographical extent of species hotspots (12–89\%) and alterations of species composition (19–91\%) will be intensified. These results imply that the influence of a strong and rapid Greenland ice sheet melting, resulting in a large AMOC weakening, can lead to a faster collapse of biodiversity across the globe.},

          The preferred conditions for evolutionary innovation represent a fundamental question, but little is known experimentally or theoretically. In this study, we focused on the potential role of polyploidy in the evolution of novel traits. We proposed a simple model and demonstrated that the evolutionary rate of polyploids is similar to more much slower than that of haploids under neutral selection or during gradual evolution. However, experiments using polyploid cyanobacteria demonstrated that the probability of achieving antibiotic resistance increased with the number of chromosomes and implied an optimal number of chromosomes. Then, we investigated the dynamics of the same model on a fitness landscape in which cells should jump over a lethal valley to increase their fitness. The evolutionary rate could be increased in polyploidy, and the optimal number of chromosomes was identified. Further, we proposed that the optimization for evolutionary innovation might determine the number of chromosomes in polyploid bacteria.},

	abstract = {Summary
          
            
              
                Pollination is a fundamental process driving the speciation of angiosperms (flowering plants). Most contemporary angiosperms are insect pollinated, but abiotic pollination by wind or water and vertebrate pollination by birds or mammals occurs in many lineages. We model the evolution of pollination across angiosperms and quantify the timing and environmental associations of pollination shifts.
              
              
                We use a robust dated phylogeny and trait-independent species-level sampling across all families of angiosperms to model the evolution of pollination modes. Data on the pollination system or syndrome of 1160 species were collated from primary literature.
              
              
                Angiosperms were ancestrally insect pollinated, and insects have pollinated angiosperms for approximately 86\% of angiosperm evolutionary history. Wind pollination evolved at least 42 times, with few reversals back to animal pollination. Transitions between insect and vertebrate pollination were more frequent: vertebrate pollination evolved at least 39 times from an insect pollinated ancestor with at least 26 reversals. The probability of wind pollination increases with habitat openness (measured by Leaf Area Index) and with distance from the equator.
              
              
                Our reconstruction of pollination across angiosperms sheds light on a key question in angiosperm macroevolution, highlighting the long history of interactions between insect pollinators and angiosperms still vital to global biodiversity today.},

	abstract = {Many species comprise multiple cytotypes that represent autopolyploids, or presumed autopolyploids, of the basic diploid cytotype. However, rarely has an autopolyploid been formally named and considered to represent a species distinct from its diploid progenitor (Zea diploperennis and Z. perennis represent a rare example). The major reasons why autopolyploids have not been named as distinct species are: (1) tradition of including multiple cytotypes in a single named species; and (2) tradition and convenience of adhering to a broad morphology-based taxonomic (or phenetic) species concept. As a result, plant biologists have underrepresented the distinct biological entities that actually exist in nature. Although it may seem "practical" to include morphologically highly similar cytotypes in one species, this practice obscures insights into evolution and speciation and hinders conservation. However, we do not suggest that all cytotypes should be named; each case must be carefully considered. A number of species comprising multiple cytotypes have been thoroughly investigated. Drawing on the literature, as well as our own experience with several autopolyploids (Tolmiea menziesii, Galax urceolata, Chamerion angustifolium, Heuchera grossulariifolia, Vaccinium corymbosum), we reassess the traditional view of plant autopolyploids as mere cytotypes. When considered carefully, many "unnamed" autopolyploids fulfill the requirements of multiple species concepts, including the biological, taxonomic, diagnosability, apomorphic, and evolutionary species concepts. Compared to the diploid parent, the autopolyploids noted above possess distinct geographic ranges, can be distinguished morphologically, and are largely reproductively isolated (via a diversity of mechanisms including reproductive and ecological isolation). These five autopolyploids (and probably many others) represent distinct evolutionary lineages; we therefore suggest that they be considered distinct species and also provide a system for naming them.},

We argue that paraphyletic higher taxa are artificial classes created by taxonomists who wish to emphasize particular characters or phenetic "gaps," and that formal recognition of such taxa conveys a misleading picture of common ancestry and character evolution. In our view, classifications should accurately reflect the nested hierarchy of monophyletic groups that is the natural outcome of the evolutionary process. Such systems facilitate the study of evolution and provide an efficient summary of character distributions. Paraphyletic groups, such as "prokaryotes," "green algae," "bryophytes," and "gymnosperms," should be abandoned, as continued recognition of such groups will only serve to retard progress in understanding evolution. Contrary to Cronquist's (1987) assertions, cladistic theory is not at odds with standard views on speciation and the existence of ancestors. Groups of interbreeding organisms can continue to exist after giving rise to descendant species, and there are several ways in which such groups, whether extant or extinct, can be incorporated into cladistic classification. In contrast, paraphyletic higher taxa are neither cohesive (integrated by gene flow) nor whole, do not serve as ancestors, and are unacceptable in the phylogenetic system. Fossils may be of great value in assessing phylogenetic relationships and are readily accommodated in cladistic classification. Cladistic studies are helping to answer major questions about plant evolution, and we anticipate increased efforts to develop a truly phylogenetic system.},

	abstract = {Merremia discoidesperma (Donn. Sm.) O'Donell (Mary's-bean) is a rarely collected and inadequately described high climbing woody liana of Chiapas, Mexico; Guatemala; Costa Rica; Hispaniola; and Cuba. There is only one record of this species being cultivated and this from Guanajuato, Mexico in 1894, though seeds are used in folk remedies. These seeds are topographically unlike other known convolvulaceous seeds, thus permitting their positive identification. Because seeds remain buoyant for more than three years in seawater, those produced in the Caribbean and Atlantic drainage region may be transported by the Gulf Stream System as far north as the Norwegian coast, a distance of about 9,500 km. Seeds produced in the Pacific drainage region from Chiapas, Mexico south to Costa Rica may be transported by the North Pacific Equatorial Current as far west as Wotho Atoll in the Marshall Islands, a distance of about 11,000 km. Records of drifting and subsequent stranding of these and other tropical New World disseminules are supported by drift bottle studies and drift debris records in the Atlantic Ocean. In the Pacific Ocean region distribution of stranded Mary's-bean seeds is supported by a similar distribution of New World pumice. There is an indication in the literature that Mary's-bean seeds may drift to the Philippines. The record from Wotho Atoll to Norway constitutes the widest drift range of any seed or fruit which has been documented. Other tropical disseminules may drift as far or farther, but their origins cannot be ascertained with certainly. The plant is described, its synonyms listed, and its distribution as well as the distribution of its stranded seeds recorded.},

Presumably opercula also do this during germination and sedimentation under natural conditions. Ipomoea alba L. produces very large (200 μm) pollen grains. During the synthesis of the exines, giant (ca. 10 μm) ubisch bodies are generated, as well as equally large sculptural gemmae that are readily detachable and which simulate ubisch bodies in pollen preparations. They could be designated 'pseudo-ubisch bodies'. Both the opercula and the ubisch bodies are interesting in terms of 'throwaway' structures in nature, and the ubisch and pseudo-ubisch bodies offer potential for future study of the chemical and physical properties of relatively pure samples of sporopollenin. Similarly, excised elaters and sculptural elements of fossil pollen and spores offer a good source of pure fossilized sporopollenin for study by modern techniques requiring only very small samples.},

Several parallels can be established with primitive Solanaceae, especially Cestreae, both in pedicel and stamen histology and in receptacle vasculature. The anthers lack, placentoids whereas, the presence of oxalate packages at the level of the stomium is reported for the first time in Convolvulaceae. The gynoecium retains some archaic characters reminiscent of Humbertia, such as a well-developed placental pedestal, and a nectariferous disk wholly embedded in the ovary wall. An apical septum is lacking in M. axilliflora but is present in M. violacea. Evolutionary gynoecial acceleration may be suggested both in vasculature and in ovarian outline, combined with a trend specific to the tribe towards the loss of a style, enlargement of the stigma, and disappearance of the septum.},

	volume = {5},
	abstract = {This is the first report of Ipomoea camea (Convolvulaceae) from lowland Costa Rica. These populations are unusual for the species in flower color, flowering season and pollinator. Other aspects of the biology of the species in Guanacaste, especially pollination, flower robbing and extrafloral nectary visitors, are discussed. This is a first report of Ipomoea carnea Jacq. from Guanacaste Province, Costa Rica. This paper also establishes a pollinator for I. carnea and describes some of its basic biology. Ipomoea carnea Jacq. (Convolvulaceae) is a woody morning glory which climbs by twining but is capable of growing unsupported to over two meters. Ipomoea carnea has been shown to be a synonym of I. fistulosa Mart. ex Choisy (Austin, in press) and I. crassicaulis (Benth.) Robins. (O'Donell, 1952). I. carnea is scarcely known from Costa Rica under any of these names, although the plant ranges from Mexico to Argentina and Peru (Matuda, 1963; O'Donell, 1952; MacBride, 1959). All the reports from Costa Rica are from high elevations: two from the region of San Ramon at 800-900 meters in 1926 and 1928, one north of Santa Ana at 940 meters at about the same time and another cultivated in San Jose in the 1930's (Standley, 1937). However, Ipomoea carnea is locally abundant in areas of Guanacaste Province (voucher specimens are deposited in the Herbario Nacional de Costa Rica). A large population grows in seasonally flooded pastures near Hacienda Palo Verde and the plant is abundant on rocky slopes above the beach at Playas del Coco, Playa Panama, Playa Hermosa and on the road approaching Playa Tamarindo, all on the northern coast of the Nicoya Peninsula. It probably ranges south along the coast into Puntarenas.},

In contrast, a second locus (W/w) is distributed in small patches or exhibits random spatial distribution. One explanation for the difference in average patch size is that high mutation rates coupled with strong natural selection may act to decrease the average patch size of white flowers. The mean genetic distance between populations of I. purpurea is independent of geographic distance over distances ranging from 50 m to 560 km. These data suggest moderate rates of interpopulation migration, possibly caused by agricultural activity and other forms of human-mediated dispersal.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            There is remarkable variation in the rate at which genetic incompatibilities in molecular interactions accumulate. In some cases, minor changes—even single-nucleotide substitutions—create major incompatibilities when hybridization forces new variants to function in a novel genetic background from an isolated population. In other cases, genes or even entire functional pathways can be horizontally transferred between anciently divergent evolutionary lineages that span the tree of life with little evidence of incompatibilities. In this review, we explore whether there are general principles that can explain why certain genes are prone to incompatibilities while others maintain interchangeability. We summarize evidence pointing to four genetic features that may contribute to greater resistance to functional replacement: (1) function in multisubunit enzyme complexes and protein–protein interactions, (2) sensitivity to changes in gene dosage, (3) rapid rate of sequence evolution, and (4) overall importance to cell viability, which creates sensitivity to small perturbations in molecular function. We discuss the relative levels of support for these different hypotheses and lay out future directions that may help explain the striking contrasts in patterns of incompatibility and interchangeability throughout the history of molecular evolution.},

To date, the weevils have been reported on a total of 35 species of Convolvulaceae and are not restricted to the genus lpomoea. The weevils have been found on seven genera in six tribes within the family. Such a wide usage of the family members suggests that the insect is oligophagous. Data indicate that the weevils may originally have utilized several members of Convolvulaceae in the lpomoea section of Erpipomoea. It is hypothesized that the weevil is native to the Old World where it became associated with the introduced American sweet potato. From the point of contact, both were spread into areas where one or the other did not previously exist.

	abstract = {ABSTRACT We review geological evidence on the origin of the modern transcontinental Amazon River, and the paleogeographic history of riverine connections among the principal sedimentary basins of northern South America through the Neogene. Data are reviewed from new geochronological datasets using radiogenic and stable isotopes, and from traditional geochronological methods, including sedimentology, structural mapping, sonic and seismic logging, and biostratigraphy. The modern Amazon River and the continental-scale Amazon drainage basin were assembled during the late Miocene and Pliocene, via some of the largest purported river capture events in Earth history. Andean sediments are first recorded in the Amazon Fan at about 10.1-9.4 Ma, with a large increase in sedimentation at about 4.5 Ma. The transcontinental Amazon River therefore formed over a period of about 4.9-5.6 million years, by means of several river capture events. The origins of the modern Amazon River are hypothesized to be linked with that of mega-wetland landscapes of tropical South America (e.g. várzeas, pantanals, seasonally flooded savannahs). Mega-wetlands have persisted over about 10\% northern South America under different configurations for {\textgreater}15 million years. Although the paleogeographic reconstructions presented are simplistic and coarse-grained, they are offered to inspire the collection and analysis of new sedimentological and geochronological datasets.

            RESUMO Este trabalho é uma revisão das evidências geológicas sobre a origem do moderno rio Amazonas transcontinental, e a história paleogeográfica das conexões ribeirinhas entre as principais bacias sedimentares do norte da América do Sul durante o Neógeno. São revisados novos conjuntos de dados geocronológicos usando isótopos radiogênicos e estáveis, e de métodos geocronológicos tradicionais, incluindo sedimentologia, mapeamento estrutural, exploração sísmica e bioestratigrafia. O atual rio Amazonas e sua bacia continental se formaram durante o final do Mioceno e do Plioceno, através de alguns dos maiores eventos de captura de rio na história da Terra. Os sedimentos andinos são registrados pela primeira vez no leque fluvial do Amazonas por volta de 10,1-9,4 Ma, com um grande aumento na sedimentação a cerca de 4,5 Ma. O rio Amazonas transcontinental, portanto, se formou durante um período de cerca de 4,9 a 5,6 milhões de anos, por meio de vários eventos de captura de rios. Acredita-se que as origens do moderno rio Amazonas estejam ligadas às paisagens de inundação da América do Sul tropical (por exemplo, várzeas, pantanais, savanas sazonalmente inundadas). As áreas pantanosas persistiram em cerca de 10\% do norte da América do Sul sob diferentes configurações por mais de 15 milhões de anos. Embora as reconstruções paleogeográficas apresentadas sejam simplistas, elas são oferecidas para inspirar a coleta e análise de novos conjuntos de dados sedimentológicos e geocronológicos.},

              Background and Aims
              Polyploidy is an important process that often generates genomic diversity within lineages, but it can also cause changes that result in loss of genomic material. Island lineages, while often polyploid, typically show chromosomal stasis but have not been investigated in detail regarding smaller-scale gene loss. Our aim was to investigate post-polyploidization genome dynamics in a chromosomally stable lineage of Malvaceae endemic to New Zealand.
            
            
              Methods
              We determined chromosome numbers and used fluorescence in situ hybridization to localize 18S and 5S rDNA. Gene sequencing of 18S rDNA, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) with intervening 5.8S rDNA, and a low-copy nuclear gene, GBSSI-1, was undertaken to determine if gene loss occurred in the New Zealand lineage following polyploidy.
            
            
              Key Results
              The chromosome number for all species investigated was 2n = 42, with the first published report for the monotypic Australian genus Asterotrichion. The five species investigated all had two 5S rDNA signals localized interstitially on the long arm of one of the largest chromosome pairs. All species, except Plagianthus regius, had two 18S rDNA signals localized proximally on the short arm of one of the smallest chromosome pairs. Plagianthus regius had two additional 18S rDNA signals on a separate chromosome, giving a total of four. Sequencing of nuclear ribosomal 18S rDNA and the ITS cistron indicated loss of historical ribosomal repeats. Phylogenetic analysis of a low-copy nuclear gene, GBSSI-1, indicated that some lineages maintained three copies of the locus, while others have lost one or two copies.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Although island endemic lineages show chromosomal stasis, with no additional changes in chromosome number, they may undergo smaller-scale processes of gene loss and concerted evolution ultimately leading to further genome restructuring and downsizing.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial and plastid functions depend on coordinated expression of proteins encoded by genomic compartments that have radical differences in copy number of organellar and nuclear genomes. In polyploids, doubling of the nuclear genome may add challenges to maintaining balanced expression of proteins involved in cytonuclear interactions. Here, we use ribo-depleted RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to analyze transcript abundance for nuclear and organellar genomes in leaf tissue from four different polyploid angiosperms and their close diploid relatives. We find that even though plastid genomes contain {\textless}1\% of the number of genes in the nuclear genome, they generate the majority (69.9 to 82.3\%) of messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts in the cell. Mitochondrial genes are responsible for a much smaller percentage (1.3 to 3.7\%) of the leaf mRNA pool but still produce much higher transcript abundances per gene compared to nuclear genome. Nuclear genes encoding proteins that functionally interact with mitochondrial or plastid gene products exhibit mRNA expression levels that are consistently more than 10-fold lower than their organellar counterparts, indicating an extreme cytonuclear imbalance at the RNA level despite the predominance of equimolar interactions at the protein level. Nevertheless, interacting nuclear and organellar genes show strongly correlated transcript abundances across functional categories, suggesting that the observed mRNA stoichiometric imbalance does not preclude coordination of cytonuclear expression. Finally, we show that nuclear genome doubling does not alter the cytonuclear expression ratios observed in diploid relatives in consistent or systematic ways, indicating that successful polyploid plants are able to compensate for cytonuclear perturbations associated with nuclear genome doubling.},

            Ipomoea cairica is a perennial creeper that has been widely introduced as a garden ornamental across tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Because it grows extremely fast and spreads easily, it has been listed as an invasive species in many countries. Here, we constructed the chromosome-level reference genome of Ipomoea cairica by Pacific Biosciences HiFi and Hi-C sequencing, with the assembly size of 733.0 Mb, the contig N50 of 43.8 Mb, the scaffold N50 of 45.7 Mb, and the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs complete rate of 98.0\%. Hi-C scaffolding assigned 97.9\% of the contigs to 15 pseudo-chromosomes. Telomeric repeat analysis reveals that 7 of the 15 pseudo-chromosomes are gapless and telomere to telomere. The transposable element content of Ipomoea cairica is 73.4\%, obviously higher than that of other Ipomoea species. A total of 38,115 protein-coding genes were predicted, with the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs complete rate of 98.5\%, comparable to that of the genome assembly, and 92.6\% of genes were functional annotated. In addition, we identified 3,039 tRNA genes and 2,403 rRNA genes in the assembled genome. Phylogenetic analysis showed that Ipomoea cairica formed a clade with Ipomoea aquatica, and they diverged from each other 8.1 million years ago. Through comparative genome analysis, we reconfirmed that a whole genome triplication event occurred specific to Convolvulaceae family and in the ancestor of the genus Ipomoea and Cuscuta. This high-quality reference genome of Ipomoea cairica will greatly facilitate the studies on the molecular mechanisms of its rapid growth and invasiveness.},

However, institutional responses have had conflicted and complex relations with Indigenous peoples. There is a growing need for meaningful engagement with—and recognition of—the centrality of Indigenous peoples’ perceptions and understanding of the changes they are experiencing to inform successful and effective place-based adaptation strategies. To fill this gap, this study focuses on the value-based perspectives and pragmatic decision-making of Shawi Indigenous men in the Peruvian Amazon. We are specifically interested in their perceptions of how their food system is changing, why it is changing, its consequences, and how/whether they are coping with and responding to this change. Our results highlight that Shawi men’s agency and conscious envisioning of their future food system intersect with the effects of government policy. Shawi men perceive that the main driver of their food-system changes, i.e., less forest food, is self-driven population growth, leading to emotions of guilt and shame. During our study, they articulated a conscious belief that future generations must transition from forest-based to agricultural foods, emphasising education as central to this transition. Additionally, results suggest that the Peruvian government is indirectly promoting Shawi population growth through policies linking population size to improved service delivery, particularly education. Despite intentional Shawi moves to transition to agriculture, this results in a loss of men’s cultural identity and has mental-health implications, creating new vulnerabilities due to increasing climatic extremes, such as flooding and higher temperatures.},

	abstract = {Taxonomic revisions, monographs and floras are the most important, and often the only source of data for assessing the extinction risk of plants, with recent revisions contributing to more accurate assessments. The recently completed Red List of South African plants involved an overview of the taxonomic literature pertaining to the South African flora, providing an opportunity to identify critical gaps in taxonomic coverage. In this study we identified taxonomic research priorities for effective conservation of South African plants. Priorities were identified at genus level, according to time since last revision, level of endemism, collecting effort, proportion of taxa included in revisions, and specimen identification confidence. Although the results indicate that 62\% of the flora has been recently revised, revisionary taxonomic output has declined drastically, particularly in the past 10 years. This decline is a result of a decrease in revisionary productivity per taxonomist and not a result of a decline in the number of working taxonomists. The family Aizoaceae is the top priority for taxonomic research with 55\% of taxa in need of revision, followed by Hyacinthaceae with 34\% of taxa not yet revised. Ericaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rutaceae, Malvaceae, Asteraceae and Acanthaceae are also priorities with over 30\% of taxa last revised before 1970. We recommend the reinstatement of the Flora of Southern Africa project in an online format in order to centralise South Africa’s existing taxonomic information and reinvigorate revisionary taxonomic study. This project will allow South Africa to fulfil its commitments to the Convention on Biodiversity by achieving Target 1 of the Global Strategy for Plant Conservation.},

	abstract = {Highly divergent sites in multiple sequence alignments (MSAs), which can stem from erroneous inference of homology and saturation of substitutions, are thought to negatively impact phylogenetic inference. Thus, several different trimming strategies have been developed for identifying and removing these sites prior to phylogenetic inference. However, a recent study reported that doing so can worsen inference, underscoring the need for alternative alignment trimming strategies. Here, we introduce ClipKIT, an alignment trimming software that, rather than identifying and removing putatively phylogenetically uninformative sites, instead aims to identify and retain parsimony-informative sites, which are known to be phylogenetically informative. To test the efficacy of ClipKIT, we examined the accuracy and support of phylogenies inferred from 14 different alignment trimming strategies, including those implemented in ClipKIT, across nearly 140,000 alignments from a broad sampling of evolutionary histories. Phylogenies inferred from ClipKIT-trimmed alignments are accurate, robust, and time saving. Furthermore, ClipKIT consistently outperformed other trimming methods across diverse datasets, suggesting that strategies based on identifying and retaining parsimony-informative sites provide a robust framework for alignment trimming.},

	abstract = {Introgression, endosymbiosis and gene transfer, i.e. Horizontal Gene Flow (HGF), are primordial sources of innovation in all domains of life. Our knowledge on HGF relies on detection methods that exploit some of its signatures left on extant genomes. One of them is the effect of HGF on branch lengths of constructed phylogenies. This signature has been formalized in statistical tests for HGF detection, and used for example to detect massive adaptive gene flows in malaria vectors or to order evolutionary events involved in eukaryogenesis. However these studies rely on the assumption that ghost lineages (all unsampled extant and extinct taxa) have little influence. We demonstrate here with simulations and data re-analysis, that when considering the more realistic condition that unsampled taxa are legion compared to sampled ones, the conclusion of these studies become unfounded or even reversed. This illustrates the necessity to recognize the existence of ghosts in evolutionary studies.},

C. formicarius is a arrival in the New World, having originated in the Old World. The sweet potato originated in the New World, and arrived in the Old World. This short period of association between sweet potato and C. formicarius may reflect a adaptation by the weevil. The sweet potato is the species most often associated with the weevils of the genus Cylas. All data indicate that the sweet potato originated in or near northwestern South America. Several species of Cylas weevils are considered pests of sweet potato in various parts of the world.

	abstract = {An adaptationist programme has dominated evolutionary thought in England and the United States during the past 40 years. It is based on faith in the power of natural selection as an optimizing agent. It proceeds by breaking an organism into unitary ‘traits’ and proposing an adaptive story for each considered separately. Trade-offs among competing selective demands exert the only brake upon perfection; non-optimality is thereby rendered as a result of adaptation as well. We criticize this approach and attempt to reassert a competing notion (long popular in continental Europe) that organisms must be analysed as integrated wholes, with
              Baupläne
              so constrained by phyletic heritage, pathways of development and general architecture that the constraints themselves become more interesting and more important in delimiting pathways of change than the selective force that may mediate change when it occurs. We fault the adaptationist programme for its failure to distinguish current utility from reasons for origin (male tyrannosaurs may have used their diminutive front legs to titillate female partners, but this will not explain
              why
              they got so small); for its unwillingness to consider alternatives to adaptive stories; for its reliance upon plausibility alone as a criterion for accepting speculative tales; and for its failure to consider adequately such competing themes as random fixation of alleles, production of non-adaptive structures by developmental correlation with selected features (allometry, pleiotropy, material compensation, mechanically forced correlation), the separability of adaptation and selection, multiple adaptive peaks, and current utility as an epiphenomenon of non-adaptive structures. We support Darwin’s own pluralistic approach to identifying the agents of evolutionary change.},

Here, we review how intrinsic postzygotic barriers can contribute to speciation, and how this role may change through time. We outline three major contributions of intrinsic postzygotic barriers to speciation. (i) reduction of gene flow: intrinsic postzygotic barriers can effectively reduce gene exchange between sympatric species pairs. We discuss the factors that influence how effective incompatibilities are in limiting gene flow. (ii) early onset of species boundaries via rapid evolution: intrinsic postzygotic barriers can evolve between recently diverged populations or incipient species, thereby influencing speciation relatively early in the process. We discuss why the early origination of incompatibilities is expected under some biological models, and detail how other (and often less obvious) incompatibilities may also serve as important barriers early on in speciation. (iii) reinforcement: intrinsic postzygotic barriers can promote the evolution of subsequent reproductive isolation through processes such as reinforcement, even between relatively recently diverged species pairs. We incorporate classic and recent empirical and theoretical work to explore these three facets of intrinsic postzygotic barriers, and provide our thoughts on recent challenges and areas in the field in which progress can be made.},

	abstract = {Understanding the evolution of biodiversity on Earth is a central aim in biology. Currently, various disciplines of science contribute to unravel evolution at all levels of life, from individual organisms to species and higher ranks, using different approaches and specific terminologies. The search for common origin, traditionally called homology, is a connecting paradigm of all studies related to evolution. However, it is not always sufficiently taken into account that defining homology depends on the hierarchical level studied (organism, population, and species), which can cause confusion. Therefore, we propose a framework to define homologies making use of existing terms, which refer to homology in different fields, but restricting them to an unambiguous meaning and a particular hierarchical level. We propose to use the overarching term “homology” only when “morphological homology,” “vertical gene transfer,” and “phylogenetic homology” are confirmed. Consequently, neither phylogenetic nor morphological homology is equal to homology. This article is intended for readers with different research backgrounds. We challenge their traditional approaches, inviting them to consider the proposed framework and offering them a new perspective for their own research.},

	abstract = {Although there has been considerable debate about whether paternal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) transmission may coexist with maternal transmission of mtDNA, it is generally believed that mitochondria and mtDNA are exclusively maternally inherited in humans. Here, we identified three unrelated multigeneration families with a high level of mtDNA heteroplasmy (ranging from 24 to 76\%) in a total of 17 individuals. Heteroplasmy of mtDNA was independently examined by high-depth whole mtDNA sequencing analysis in our research laboratory and in two Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments and College of American Pathologists-accredited laboratories using multiple approaches. A comprehensive exploration of mtDNA segregation in these families shows biparental mtDNA transmission with an autosomal dominantlike inheritance mode. Our results suggest that, although the central dogma of maternal inheritance of mtDNA remains valid, there are some exceptional cases where paternal mtDNA could be passed to the offspring. Elucidating the molecular mechanism for this unusual mode of inheritance will provide new insights into how mtDNA is passed on from parent to offspring and may even lead to the development of new avenues for the therapeutic treatment for pathogenic mtDNA transmission.},

	abstract = {Being at the western fringe of Europe, Iberia had a peculiar prehistory and a complex pattern of Neolithization. A few studies, all based on modern populations, reported the presence of DNA of likely African origin in this region, generally concluding it was the result of recent gene flow, probably during the Islamic period. Here, we provide evidence of much older gene flow from Africa to Iberia by sequencing whole genomes from four human remains from northern Portugal and southern Spain dated around 4000 years BP (from the Middle Neolithic to the Bronze Age). We found one of them to carry an unequivocal sub-Saharan mitogenome of most probably West or West-Central African origin, to our knowledge never reported before in prehistoric remains outside Africa. Our analyses of ancient nuclear genomes show small but significant levels of sub-Saharan African affinity in several ancient Iberian samples, which indicates that what we detected was not an occasional individual phenomenon, but an admixture event recognizable at the population level. We interpret this result as evidence of an early migration process from Africa into the Iberian Peninsula through a western route, possibly across the Strait of Gibraltar.},

Perhaps this concept is true for the numbers of individuals, but it is beginning to appear that the greatest species diversity is in the plateau regions such as the Guayana Highland, the margins of the Andes, and the Brazilian Shield. Until recently there were few collections from any of these areas, particularly the Guayana Highland. In fact, except for the now outdated treatments of the family by van Ooststroom and Pittier et al, the more recent study of the tribe Erycibeae, and an unpublished study of the family for the "Flora de Venezuela" (Austin, mss.), little has been known of the group in the entire Guayana region. We recently examined the collections made by Dr. Bassett Maguire and his colleagues over the past few years and, to date, have found fourteen genera and a total of forty-four species of Convolvulaceae in the Guayana Highland. A few others are known from the Crystalline Shield and may be found within the Highland in the future. Several of these species were unexpected, and one is new to science.},

The effects of anther removal on filament growth were examined in I. nil Three-quarters of the calyx and corolla tissues were removed in order to emasculate the stamens. This removal caused filament growth to be inhibited in the intact stamens (69 hr before anthesis) as well as the emasculated stamens (69 to 21 hr before anthesis). When the ethylene biosynthesis inhibitors CoCl2 and aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) were applied in separate experiments (to eliminate wound ethylene generated by the damaged tissues), filament growth was promoted to control levels observed in intact flower buds (69 hr before anthesis). Our data suggest that the wounding effect from the calyx and corolla tissues and subsequent reduction in filament growth override any observable effects with anther removal on filament growth. Apparently, the removal of the calyx and corolla tissues severs a normal hormonal relationship between these floral organs and the developing filament.},

Currently, key areas of research can be divided into the reconstruction of phylogeny and taxonomy, here defined as the description, delimitation and inventory of species. Molecular data have great potential to elucidate the relationships between taxa and, together with recent methodological advances, have instigated a resurgence of interest in phylogeny reconstruction. A literature survey indicates a decline in interest and investment in taxonomy, as defined above, an activity for which morphological data supply most information. We highlight the need to restore the balance in activity and profile between phylogeny reconstruction and morphology-based taxonomy, to redress the plight of systematics and dependent biological research.},

	abstract = {Pollen of 18 species of Ipomoea in Taiwan was examined in LM and SEM. Light microscope study of pollen morphology has shown that all examined species share common pollen morphological characters - spherical shape, pantoporate apertures and tectum with spinulate processes. On the basis of exine stratification, two different groups of this genus were defined: The Group 1 pollen include I. acuminata and 9 other species, possess spines, extraporal regions and tetragonal to hexagonal areas. The pores are surrounded by an extraporal region, and the spines and the ridges of the bacula form a tetragonal to hexagonal area around each extraporal region. Each pore is covered with an operculum which is peeled off after acetolysis. Fine reticula are present all over the surface of the grain. The reticula consist of very minute lumina. The Group 2 pollen include Ⅰ. obscura and 7 other species. The extraporal regions and tetragonal to hexagonal areas are absent. Minute lumina are also present all over the surface of the grain. A key for distinguishing Taiwan's various species of Ipomoea, based on exine stratification and spinal characteristics, was made.},

	abstract = {En el siguiente trabajo se hace una primera aproximación a factores como el acceso a los recursos alimenticios de tipo vegetal y la diferenciación social; a partir de una serie de análisis arqueobotánicos enfocados en la extracción e identificación de almidones, en piezas arqueológicas de tipo cerámico y lítico provenientes del sitio arqueológico de Santa María la Antigua del Darién. Precisamente, esta es la primera ciudad española fundada en América, ubicada en el departamento del Chocó (Colombia). Datada aproximadamente de entre 1510 y 1524, periodo del contacto entre los primeros exploradores y conquistadores españoles y europeos, con las comunidades indígenas que habitaron en dicho momento el continente americano. Justamente, en la presente investigación, se seleccionan piezas arqueológicas procedentes de dos zonas colindantes, que presentan una materialidad diferente en los mismos niveles estratigráficos, poblado indígena (Darién) y poblado español (Santa María la Antigua). Por ende, a estas piezas se les realizaron diferentes técnicas de
extracción de almidones (seco, húmedo, sonificado) con el fin de, primero; evaluar la eficacia de
las diferentes técnicas de extracción de almidones en laboratorio, segundo; identificar un acceso
diferenciado de los recursos alimenticios entre ambas zonas a partir de los almidones recuperados.
De hecho, los resultados obtenidos demostraron un acceso diferenciado de los recursos alimenticios entre ambas zonas, con lo cual se plantea toda una discusión en torno a los mismos y la posible diferenciación social generada en torno a la comida y su potencial control por parte de los grupos españoles sobre los indígenas. Gracias a estos resultados, se identificaron una serie de géneros de plantas, en donde se logra identificar una de las evidencias más tempranas de Triticum aestivum en tierra firme continental.},

	abstract = {En este trabajo preliminar se ha aplicado el estudio arqueobotánico de gránulos de almidón en un fragmento de burén que perteneció a una comunidad agroalfarera tardía del Oriente de Cuba y que vivió en lo que hoy conocemos como Macambo II, provincia de Guantánamo. Los almidones arqueológicos recuperados aportan la primera evidencia directa para Cuba del uso y potencial consumo de los productos derivados de 4 plantas de importancia económica en dicho sitio. Se genera una discusión en la que se plantean los posibles panoramas involucrados en el tratamiento previo de los órganos aprovechados de las plantas, que contrastan sustancialmente con lo que fue planteado por los cronistas de la región. Se aporta evidencia adicional que rechaza la generalizada
percepción de que el burén fue un artefacto utilizado únicamente en la elaboración del pan de casabe. Con este estudio de aproximación se ha pretendido mostrar las implicaciones positivas que tiene el tipo de aplicaciones analíticas aquí utilizado para los temas de investigación relacionados con la naturaleza de las interacciones entre los grupos humanos precolombinos y las plantas ricas en almidón utilizadas por ellos en cualquier periodo precolombino antillano.},
