	title = {The challenges of classifying big genera such as \textit{{Ipomoea}}},
	abstract = {Big genera represent a significant proportion of the world’s plants. However, comprehensive taxonomic and evolutionary studies of these genera are often complicated by their size and geographic spread. This paper explores the challenges faced in classifying these megadiverse plant groups consequent to the existing tension between diagnosability and increasing levels of resolution from molecular sequence data. We use recent examples from across Angiosperms to illustrate how monophyly, diagnosability and completeness interplay with each other in attempts to classify several big genera and, specifically, the genus Ipomoea (Convolvulaceae). Ipomoea and the tribe Ipomoeeae have been the object of recent taxonomic and phylogenetic studies that highlight the limitations of previous attempts to classify the group, and show that the smaller segregate genera traditionally recognised in Ipomoeeae are nested within Ipomoea and are neither monophyletic nor diagnosable. We argue that existing classifications must be abandoned, and that recognising an expanded Ipomoea that incorporates all segregate genera of the Ipomoeeae is the most appropriate solution as it reconciles the properties of monophyly, diagnosability and completeness, and favours nomenclatural stability.},

The second species, K. capixaba, should be placed in Ehretiaceae.

The assessment of tendencies in the distribution and resilience of endangered medicinal species against global change can be an excellent tool to predict and minimize future negative effects, even more so if we consider that these species may be useful to us. Spain is one of the richest countries in plant diversity along the Mediterranean basin, and many representatives of the Spanish flora are medicinal plants. Under scenarios of climate change, the distribution ranges of many of these species are likely to alter. In this paper we used ecological niche modeling to predict future changes in the distribution of 41 medicinal plants included in the 2013 assessment of threatened species in Spain. We generated climate-based niche models for each medicinal species and projected them for each decade from 2010 until 2080. Our results identified and prioritized the most vulnerable species and areas to future predicted changes. These results should be useful for conservation planning and especially for prioritizing areas for protection.},

            Species are crucial to most branches of biological research, yet remain controversial in terms of definition, delimitation, and reality. The difficulty of resolving the “species problem” stems from the tension between their theoretical concept as groups of evolving and highly variable organisms and the practical need for a stable and comparable unit of biology. Here, we suggest that treating species as a heuristic can be consistent with a theoretical definition of what species are and with the practical means by which they are identified and delimited. Specifically, we suggest that theoretically species are heuristic since they comprise clusters of closely related individuals responding in a similar manner to comparable sets of evolutionary and ecological forces, whilst they are practically heuristic because they are identifiable by the congruence of contingent properties indicative of those forces. This reconciliation of the theoretical basis of species with their practical applications in biological research allows for a loose but relatively consistent definition of species based on the strategic analysis and integration of genotypic, phenotypic, and ecotypic data.

All 423 species are described and information is provided on their ecology and distribution, with citations from all countries from which they are reported. Notes are provided on salient characteristics and taxonomic issues related to individual species. A full synonymy is provided and many names are lectotypified. An extensive introduction discusses the delimitation and history of Ipomoea arguing that a broad generic concept is the only rational solution in the light of recent phylogenetic advances. Although no formal infrageneric classification is proposed, attention is drawn to the major clades of the genus and several morphologically well-defined clades are discussed including those traditionally treated under the names Arborescens, Batatas, Pharbitis, Calonyction and Quamoclit. Identification keys are provided on a regional basis including multi-entry keys for the main continental blocks. Six species are described as new, Ipomoea nivea J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland from Peru, I. apodiensis from Brazil, I. calcicola J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, I. pochutlensis J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland, I. zacatecana J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and I. ramulosa J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland from Mexico, while var. australis of I. cordatotriloba is raised to specific status as I. australis (O’Donell) J.R.I. Wood \& P. Muñoz. New subspecies for I. nitida (subsp. krapovickasii J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) and for I. chenopodiifolia (subsp. bellator J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) are described. The status of previously recognized species and varieties is changed to subspecies for I. amnicola (subsp. chiliantha (Hallier f.) J.R.I.

Wood \& Scotland and subsp. sepacuitenensis (Donn. Sm.) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland) and I. ternifolia (subsp. leptotoma (Torrey) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland.). I. subincana and I. angustata are treated as var. angustata (Brandegee) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland and var. subincana (Choisy) J.R.I. Wood \& Scotland of I. barbatisepala and I. brasiliensis respectively. Attention is drawn to a number of hitherto poorly recognized phenomena in the genus including a very large radiation centred on the Parana region of South America and another on the Caribbean Islands, a strong trend towards an amphitropical distribution in the New World, the existence of a relatively large number of species with a pantropical distribution and of many species in different clades with storage roots, most of which have never been evaluated for economic purposes. The paper is illustrated with 208 figures composed of line drawings and photographs.},

	abstract = {Taxonomic monographs have the potential to make a unique contribution to the understanding of global biodiversity. However, such studies, now rare, are often considered too daunting to undertake within a realistic time frame, especially as the world's collections have doubled in size in recent times. Here, we report a global-scale monographic study of morning glories (Ipomoea) that integrated DNA barcodes and high-throughput sequencing with the morphological study of herbarium specimens. Our approach overhauled the taxonomy of this megadiverse group, described 63 new species and uncovered significant increases in net diversification rates comparable to the most iconic evolutionary radiations in the plant kingdom. Finally, we show that more than 60 species of Ipomoea, including sweet potato, independently evolved storage roots in pre-human times, indicating that the storage root is not solely a product of human domestication but a trait that predisposed the species for cultivation. This study demonstrates how the world's natural history collections can contribute to global challenges in the Anthropocene.},

A plant of American origin, sweet potato had an important role in human history in Rapa Nui and the Pacific, but it is not the only species of morning glory present in the Pacific nor is it the only morning glory species used by islanders. In this chapter, we review the narratives of early European explorers, modern floristic accounts and descriptions of archaeological remains in search of references to sweet potato and other morning glory species on Rapa Nui. We also discuss sweet potato presence on the island and provide biological information relevant to the study of sweet potato archaeological remains. Our global monographic study of the morning glories allows us to provide a botanical perspective, often missing, on the question of how sweet potato arrived in the Pacific and in Rapa Nui.},

	abstract = {Three important properties associated with a classification of any group of organisms are diagnosability, monophyly and resolution. In this chapter we explore the interrelationships between these three properties in the context of cryptic taxa, here defined as a clade with no obvious diagnostic morphological support. We present the view that the number of nodes on a phylogenetic tree of all flowering plants that have morphological diagnostic support is less than five percent; as such, cryptic nodes are much more common than non-cryptic nodes. Because of this, we suggest that the phrase ‘cryptic nodes’ is a preferable description as opposed to cryptic taxa because taxa in the sense of traditional classifications are generally diagnostic. By reference to a global taxonomic study of the genus Ipomoea, we discuss the role of diagnosability at various scales including major infrageneric clade, genus and species. We demonstrate that the level of diagnosability for Ipomoea is relatively low, therefore making cryptic nodes the rule and not the exception. We provide several examples of such cryptic nodes, detail how we discovered them and place them in a wider conceptual framework of diagnosability in angiosperms.},
