	<p class="intro">Welcome to my personal website! I am Pablo Muñoz-Rodríguez, a Spanish biologist currently working as a Ramón y Cajal Research Fellow at the Department of Biodiversity, Ecology & Evolution, Complutense University of Madrid (Spain). My research focuses on the systematics of the plant genus <i>Ipomoea</i> (family Convolvulaceae), commonly known as the morning glories, and on the origin and evolution of its most famous member, the sweet potato (<i>Ipomoea batatas</i> (L.) Lam.). I also participate in various projects studying the systematics of other groups of tropical plants, as well as have worked on biodiversity conservation and biodiversity data management. I am an active member of several academic societies and I am also involved in several projects of science communication. Please use the options above to access information and updates on my research.</p>
